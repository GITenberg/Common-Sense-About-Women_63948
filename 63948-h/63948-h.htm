  <h2 class='c008'>COMMON SENSE ABOUT WOMEN.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>I.<br /> <span class='large'>TOO MUCH NATURAL HISTORY.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Lord Melbourne, speaking of the fine ladies in
London who were fond of talking about their ailments,
used to complain that they gave him too much of their
natural history. There are a good many writers—usually
men—who, with the best intentions, discuss
woman as if she had merely a physical organization,
and as if she existed only for one object, the production
and rearing of children. Against this some protest
may well be made.</p>

<p class='c014'>Doubtless there are few things more important to a
community than the health of its women. The Sandwich-Island
proverb says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If strong is the frame of the mother,</div>
      <div class='line'>The son will give laws to the people.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And, in nations where all men give laws, all men
need mothers of strong frames.</p>

<p class='c014'>Moreover, there is no harm in admitting that all the
rules of organization are imperative; that soul and
body, whether of man or woman, are made in harmony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>so that each part of our nature must accept the
limitations of the other. A man’s soul may yearn to
the stars; but so long as the body cannot jump so high,
he must accept the body’s veto. It is the same with
any veto interposed in advance by the physical structure
of woman. Nobody objects to this general principle.
It is only when clerical gentlemen or physiological
gentlemen undertake to go a step farther, and
put in that veto on their own responsibility, that it is
necessary to say, “Hands off, gentlemen! Precisely
because women are women, they, not you, are to settle
that question.”</p>

<p class='c014'>One or two points are clear. Every specialist is
liable to overrate his own specialty; and the man
who thinks of woman only as a wife and mother is apt
to forget, that, before she was either of these, she was
a human being. “Women, as such,” says an able
writer, “are constituted for purposes of maternity and
the continuation of mankind.” Undoubtedly, and so
were men, as such, constituted for paternity. But very
much depends on what relative importance we assign to
the phrase, “as such.” Even an essay so careful, so
moderate, and so free from coarseness, as that here
quoted, suggests, after all, a slight one-sidedness,—perhaps
a natural re-action from the one-sidedness of
those injudicious reformers who allow themselves to
speak slightingly of “the merely animal function of
child-bearing.” Higher than either—wiser than both
put together—is that noble statement with which Jean
Paul begins his fine essay on the education of girls in
“Levana.” “Before being a wife or mother, one is a
human being; and neither motherly nor wifely destination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>can overbalance or replace the human, but must
become its means, not end. As above the poet, the
painter, or the hero, so above the mother, does the
human being rise pre-eminent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is sure anchorage. We can hold to this. And,
fortunately, all the analogies of nature sustain this
position. Throughout nature the laws of sex rule
everywhere; but they rule a kingdom of their own,
always subordinate to the greater kingdom of the vital
functions. Every creature, male or female, finds in its
sexual relations only a subordinate part of its existence.
The need of food, the need of exercise, the joy of living,
these come first, and absorb the bulk of its life,
whether the individual be male or female. This <em>Antiope</em>
butterfly, that flits at this moment past my window,—the
first of the season,—spends almost all its existence
in a form where the distinction of sex lies dormant: a
few days, I might almost say a few hours, comprise its
whole sexual consciousness, and the majority of its
race die before reaching that epoch. The law of sex is
written absolutely through the whole insect world. Yet
everywhere it is written as a secondary and subordinate
law. The life which is common to the sexes is the
principal life; the life which each sex leads, “as
such,” is a minor and subordinate thing.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same rule pervades nature. Two riders pass
down the street before my window. One rides a horse,
the other a mare. The animals were perhaps foaled in
the same stable, of the same progenitors. They have
been reared alike, fed alike, trained alike, ridden alike;
they need the same exercise, the same grooming; nine
tenths of their existence are the same, and only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>other tenth is different. Their whole organization is
marked by the distinction of sex: but, though the
marking is ineffaceable, the distinction is not the first
or most important fact.</p>

<p class='c014'>If this be true of the lower animals, it is far more
true of the higher. The mental and moral laws of the
universe touch us first and chiefly as human beings.
We eat our breakfasts as human beings, not as men
and women; and it is the same with nine tenths of our
interests and duties in life. In legislating or philosophizing
for woman, we must neither forget that she has
an organization distinct from that of man, nor must we
exaggerate the fact. Not “first the womanly and then
the human,” but first the human and then the womanly,
is to be the order of her training.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>II.<br /> <span class='large'>DARWIN, HUXLEY, AND BUCKLE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When any woman, old or young, asks the question,
Which among all modern books ought I to read first?
the answer is plain. She should read Buckle’s lecture
before the Royal Institution upon “The Influence
of Woman on the Progress of Knowledge.” It is
one of two papers contained in a thin volume called
“Essays by Henry Thomas Buckle.” As a means
whereby a woman may become convinced that her sex
has a place in the intellectual universe, this little essay
is almost indispensable. Nothing else takes its place.</p>

<p class='c014'>Darwin and Huxley seem to make woman simply a
lesser man, weaker in body and mind,—an affectionate
and docile animal, of inferior grade. That there
is any aim in the distinction of the sexes, beyond the
perpetuation of the race, is nowhere recognized by
them, so far as I know. That there is any thing in
the intellectual sphere to correspond to the physical
difference; that here also the sexes are equal yet diverse,
and the natural completion and complement of
the other,—this neither Huxley nor Darwin explicitly
recognizes. And with the utmost admiration for their
great teachings in other ways, I must think that here
they are open to the suspicion of narrowness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Huxley wrote in “The Reader,” in 1864, a short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>paper called “Emancipation—Black and White,” in
which, while taking generous ground in behalf of the
legal and political position of woman, he yet does it
pityingly, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de haut en bas</span></i>, as for a creature hopelessly
inferior, and so heavily weighted already by her sex,
that she should be spared all further trials. Speaking
through an imaginary critic, who seems to represent
himself, he denies “even the natural equality of the
sexes,” and declares “that in every excellent character,
whether mental or physical, the average woman
is inferior to the average man, in the sense of having
that character less in quantity and lower in quality.”
Finally he goes so far as “to defend the startling paradox
that even in physical beauty, man is the superior.”
He admits that for a brief period of early
youth the case may be doubtful, but claims that after
thirty the superior beauty of man is unquestionable.
Thus reasons Huxley; the whole essay being included
in his volume of “Lay Sermons, Addresses, and
Reviews.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Pp. 22, 23, Am. ed.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Darwin’s best statements on the subject may be
found in his “Descent of Man.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> He is, as usual,
more moderate and guarded than Huxley. He says,
for instance: “It is generally admitted that with
women the powers of intuition, of rapid perception,
and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked
than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are
characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a
past and lower state of civilization.” Then he passes
to the usual assertion that man has thus far attained to
a higher eminence than woman. “If two lists were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>made of the most eminent men and women in poetry,
painting, sculpture, music,—comprising composition
and performance,—history, science, and philosophy,
with half a dozen names under each subject, the two
lists would not bear comparison.” But the obvious
answer, that nearly every name on his list, upon the
masculine side, would probably be taken from periods
when woman was excluded from any fair competition,—this
he does not seem to recognize at all. Darwin,
of all men, must admit that superior merit generally
arrives later, not earlier, on the scene; and the question
for him to answer is, not whether woman equalled
man in the first stages of the intellectual “struggle
for life,” but whether she is not gaining on him now.@</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. II., 311, Am. Ed.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>If, in spite of man’s enormous advantage in the
start, woman has already overtaken his very best performances
in several of the highest intellectual departments,—as,
for instance, prose fiction and dramatic
representation,—then it is mere dogmatism in Mr.
Darwin to deny that she may yet do the same in other
departments. We in this generation have actually seen
this success achieved by Rachel and Ristori in the one
art, by “George Sand” and “George Eliot” in the
other. Woman is, then, visibly gaining on man, in the
sphere of intellect; and, if so, Mr. Darwin, at least,
must accept the inevitable inference.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this is arguing the question on the superficial
facts merely. Buckle goes deeper, and looks to principles.
That superior quickness of women, which
Darwin dismisses so lightly as something belonging to
savage epochs, is to Buckle the sign of a quality which
he holds essential, not only to literature and art, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to science itself. Go among ignorant women, he says,
and you will find them more quick and intelligent than
equally ignorant men. A woman will usually tell you
the way in the street more readily than a man can; a
woman can always understand a foreigner more easily;
and Dr. Currie says in his letters, that when a laborer
and his wife came to consult him, he always got all the
information from the wife. Buckle illustrates this at
some length, and points out that a woman’s mind is
by its nature deductive and quick; a man’s mind, inductive
and slow; that each has its value, and that
science profoundly needs both.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will endeavor,” he says, “to establish two propositions.
First, that women naturally prefer the deductive
method to the inductive. Secondly, that
women, by encouraging in men deductive habits of
thought, have rendered an immense though unconscious
service to the progress of science, by preventing
scientific investigators from being as exclusively
inductive as they would otherwise be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then he shows that the most important scientific
discoveries of modern times—as of the law of gravitation
by Newton, the law of the forms of crystals
by Haüy, and the metamorphosis of plants by Goethe—were
all essentially the results of that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a priori</span></i> or
deductive method, “which, during the last two centuries,
Englishmen have unwisely despised.” They were
all the work, in a manner, of the imagination,—of
the intuitive or womanly quality of mind. And nothing
can be finer or truer than the words in which
Buckle predicts the benefits that are to come from the
intellectual union of the sexes for the work of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>future. “In that field which we and our posterity
have yet to traverse, I firmly believe that the imagination
will effect quite as much as the understanding.
Our poetry will have to re-enforce our logic, and we
must feel quite as much as we must argue. Let us,
then, hope that the imaginative and emotional minds
of one sex will continue to accelerate the great progress
by acting upon and improving the colder and
harder minds of the other sex. By this coalition, by
this union of different faculties, different tastes, and
different methods, we shall go on our way with the
greater ease.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>III.<br /> <span class='large'>WHICH IS THE STRONGER?</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What is strength,—the brute hardness of iron, or
the more delicate strength of steel? Which is the
stronger,—the physical frame that can strike the
harder blow, or that which can endure the greater
strain and yet last longer? “Man can lift a heavier
weight,” says a writer on physiology, “but woman
can watch more enduringly at the bedside of her sick
child.” The strain upon the system of all women who
have borne and reared children is as great in its way
as that upon the system of the carpenter or the woodchopper;
and the power to endure it is as properly to
be called strength.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, which is the stronger in the domain of will,—the
man who carries his points by energy and
command, or the woman who carries hers by patience
and persuasion? the man in the household who leads
and decides, or the woman who foresees, guards, manages?
the mother of the family, who puts the commas
and semicolons in her children’s lives, as Jean Paul
Richter says, or the father who puts in the colons and
periods? It may be hard to say which type of strength
is the more to be admired, but it is clear that they are
both genuine types.</p>

<p class='c014'>One grows tired of hearing young men who can do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>nothing but row, or swing dumb-bells, and are thrown
wholly “off their training” by the loss of a night’s
sleep, speak contemptuously of the physical weakness
of a woman who can watch with a sick person half a
dozen nights together. It is absurd to hear a man
who is prostrated by a single reverse in business speak
of being “encumbered” with a wife who can perhaps
alter the habits of a lifetime more easily than he can
abandon his half-dollar cigars. It is amusing to read
the criticisms of languid and graceful masculine essayists
on the want of vigorous intellect in the sex that
wrote “Aurora Leigh” and “Middlemarch” and
“Consuelo.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be that a man’s strength is not a woman’s,
or a woman’s strength that of a man. I am arguing
for equivalence, not identity. The greater part played
in the phenomena of woman’s strength by sensibility
and impulse and variations and tears—this does not
affect the matter. What I have never been able to
see is, that woman as such is, in the long-run and
tried by all the tests, a weaker being than man. And
it would seem that any man, in proportion as he lives
longer and sees more of life, must have the conceit
taken out of him by actual contact with some woman—be
she mother, sister, wife, daughter, or friend—who
is not only as strong as himself in all substantial
regards, but it may be, on the whole, a little stronger.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SPIRIT OF SMALL TYRANNY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When Mr. John Smauker and the Bath footmen
invited Sam Weller to their “swarry,” consisting of a
boiled leg of mutton, each guest had some expression
of contempt and wrath for the humble little greengrocer
who served them,—“in the true spirit,” Dickens
says, “of the very smallest tyranny.” The very
fact that they were subject to being ordered about in
their own persons gave them a peculiar delight in issuing
tyrannical orders to others: just as sophomores in
college torment freshmen because other sophomores
once teased the present tormentors themselves; and
Irishmen denounce the Chinese for underbidding them
in the labor-market, precisely as they were themselves
denounced by native-born Americans thirty years ago.
So it has sometimes seemed to me that the men whose
own positions and claims are really least commanding
are those who hold most resolutely that women should
be kept in their proper place of subordination.</p>

<p class='c014'>A friend of mine maintains the theory that men large
and strong in person are constitutionally inclined to do
justice to women, as fearing no competition from them
in the way of bodily strength; but that small and weak
men are apt to be vehemently opposed to any thing
like equality in the sexes. He quotes in defence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>his theory the big soldier in London who justified himself
for allowing his little wife to chastise him, on the
ground that it pleased her and did not hurt him; and
on the other hand cites the extreme domestic tyranny
of the dwarf Quilp. He declares that in any difficult
excursion among woods and mountains, the guides and
the able-bodied men are often willing to have women
join the party, while it is sure to be opposed by those
who doubt their own strength or are reluctant to display
their weakness. It is not necessary to go so far
as my friend goes; but many will remember some fact
of this kind, making such theories appear not quite so
absurd as at first.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus it seems from the “Life and Letters” of
Sydney Dobell, the English poet, that he was opposed
both to woman suffrage and woman authorship, believing
the movement for the former to be a “blundering
on to the perdition of womanhood.” It appears that
against all authorship by women his convictions yearly
grew stronger, he regarding it as “an error and an
anomaly.” It seems quite in accordance with my
friend’s theory to hear, after this, that Sydney Dobell
was slight in person and a life-long invalid; nor is it
surprising, on the same theory, that his poetry took no
deep root, and that it will not be likely to survive long,
except perhaps in his weird ballad of “Ravelston.”
But he represents a large class of masculine intellects,
of secondary and mediocre quality, whose opinions on
this subject are not so much opinions as instinctive
prejudices against a competitor who may turn out their
superior. Whether they know it, or not, their aversion
to the authorship of women is very much like the conviction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of a weak pedestrian, that women are not naturally
fitted to take long walks; or the opinion of a man
whose own accounts are in a muddle, that his wife is
constitutionally unfitted to understand business.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a pity to praise either sex at the expense of the
other. The social inequality of the sexes was not produced
so much by the voluntary tyranny of man, as by
his great practical advantage at the outset; human history
necessarily beginning with a period when physical
strength was sole ruler. It is unnecessary, too, to
consider in how many cases women may have justified
this distrust; and may have made themselves as
obnoxious as Horace Walpole’s maids of honor, whose
coachman left his savings to his son on condition that
he should never marry a maid of honor. But it is safe
to say that on the whole the feeling of contempt for
women, and the love to exercise arbitrary power over
them, is the survival of a crude impulse which the world
is outgrowing, and which is in general least obvious in
the manliest men. That clear and able English writer,
Walter Bagehot, well describes “the contempt for
physical weakness and for women which marks early
society. The non-combatant population is sure to fare
ill during the ages of combat. But these defects, too,
are cured or lessened; women have now marvellous
means of winning their way in the world; and mind
without muscle has far greater force than muscle without
mind.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c004'>V.<br /> <span class='large'>“THE NOBLE SEX.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A highly educated American woman of my acquaintance
once employed a French tutor in Paris, to assist
her in teaching Latin to her little grandson. The
Frenchman brought with him a Latin grammar, written
in his own language, with which my friend was quite
pleased, until she came to a passage relating to the
masculine gender in nouns, and claiming grammatical
precedence for it on the ground that the male sex is
the noble sex,—”<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sexe noble</span></i>.” “Upon that,” she
said, “I burst forth in indignation, and the poor teacher
soon retired. But I do not believe,” she added, “that
the Frenchman has the slightest conception, up to this
moment, of what I could find in that phrase to displease
me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not suppose he could. From the time when
the Salic Law set French women aside from the royal
succession, on the ground that the kingdom of France
was “too noble to be ruled by a woman,” the claim
of nobility has been all on one side. The State has
strengthened the Church in this theory, the Church has
strengthened the State; and the result of all is, that
French grammarians follow both these high authorities.
When even the good Père Hyacinthe teaches, through
the New York Independent, that the husband is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>direct the conscience of his wife, precisely as the father
directs that of his child, what higher philosophy can
you expect of any Frenchman than to maintain the
claims of “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sexe noble</span></i>”?</p>

<p class='c014'>We see the consequence, even among the most
heterodox Frenchmen. Rejecting all other precedents
and authorities, the poor Communists still held to this.
Consider, for instance, this translation of a marriage-contract
under the Commune, which lately came to
light in a trial reported in the “Gazette des Tribunaux:”—</p>

<h4 class='c019'>FRENCH REPUBLIC.</h4>

in number and in person. But with what a lordly freedom
from all obligation does citizen Anet, representative
of this nobility of sex, accept the allegiance! The
citizeness may “follow him,” certainly,—so long as she
is not in the way,—and she must “love him always;”
but he is not bound. Why should he be? It would
be quite ungrammatical.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet, after all is said and done, there is a brutal honesty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>in this frank subordination of the woman according
to the grammar. It has the same merit with the old
Russian marriage-consecration: “Here, wolf, take thy
lamb,” which at least put the thing clearly, and made
no nonsense about it. I do not know that anywhere in
France the wedding ritual is now so severely simple as
that, but I know that in some rural villages of that
country the bride is still married in a mourning-gown.
I should think she would be.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>VI.<br /> <span class='large'>PHYSIOLOGICAL CROAKING.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A very old man once came to King Agis of Sparta,
to lament over the degeneracy of the times. The king
replied, “What you say must be true; for I remember
that when I was a boy, I heard my father say that
when he was a boy, he heard my grandfather say the
same thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a sufficient answer to most of the croakers, that
doubtless the same things have been said in every generation
since the beginning of recorded time. Till within
twenty years, for instance, it has been the accepted
theory, that civilized society lost in vigor what it
gained in refinement. This is now generally admitted
to be a delusion growing out of the fact that civilization
keeps alive many who would have died under barbarism.
These feebler persons enter into the average, and
keep down the apparent health of the community; but
it is the triumph of civilization that they exist at all.
I am inclined to think, that when we come to compare
the nineteenth century with the seventeenth, as regards
the health of women and the size of families, we shall
find much the same result.</p>

<p class='c014'>We look around us, and see many invalid or childless
women. We say the Pilgrim mothers were not like
these. We cheat ourselves by this perpetual worship
of the pioneer grandmother. How the young bachelors,
who write dashing articles in the newspapers, denounce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>their “nervous” sisters, for instance, and belabor them
with cruel memories of their ancestors! “The great-grandmother
of this helpless creature, very likely, was
a pioneer in the woods; reared a family of twelve or
thirteen children; spun, scrubbed, wove, and cooked;
lived to eighty-five, with iron muscles, a broad chest
and keen, clear eyes.” But no one can study the genealogies
of our older New England families without
noticing how many of the aunts and sisters and daughters
of this imaginary Amazon died young. I think
there may be the same difference between the households
of to-day and the Puritan households that there is
confessedly between the American families and the
Irish: fewer children are born, but more survive.</p>

<p class='c014'>And is it so sure that the families are diminishing,
even as respects the number of children born? This is
a simple question of arithmetic, for which the materials
are being rapidly accumulated by the students of family
history. Let each person take the lines of descent
which are nearest to himself, to begin with, and compare
the number of children born in successive generations.
I have, for instance, two such tables at hand,
representing two of the oldest New England families,
which meet in the same family of children in this generation.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be seen that the last generation exhibits the
largest family in the first line, and almost the largest—much
beyond the average—in the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, when we consider the great change in all the
habits of living, since the Puritan days, and all the
vicissitudes to which a single line is exposed,—a whole
household being sometimes destroyed by a single hereditary
disease,—this is certainly a fair exhibit. These
two genealogies were taken at random, because they
happened to be nearest at hand. But I suspect any
extended examination of genealogies, either of the Puritan
families of New England, or the Dutch families of
New York, would show much the same result. Some
of the descendants of the old Stuyvesant race, for
instance, exhibit in this generation a physical vigor
which it is impossible that the doughty governor himself
could have surpassed.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are undoubtedly many moral and physiological
sins committed, tending to shorten and weaken life;
but the progress of knowledge more than counterbalances
them. No man of middle age can look at a class
of students from our older colleges without seeing them
to be physically superior to the same number of college
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>boys taken twenty-five years ago. The organization
of girls being far more delicate and complicated, the
same reform reaches them more promptly, but it reaches
them at last. The little girls of the present day eat
better food, wear more healthful clothing, and breathe
more fresh air, than their mothers did. The introduction
of india-rubber boots and waterproof cloaks alone
has given a fresh lease of life to multitudes of women,
who otherwise would have been kept housed whenever
there was so much as a sprinkling of rain.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is desirable, certainly, to venerate our grandmothers;
but I am inclined to think, on the whole, that
their great-granddaughters will be the best.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>VII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR GRANDMOTHERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Every young woman of the present generation, so
soon as she ventures to have a headache or a set of
nerves, is immediately confronted by indignant critics
with her grandmother. If the grandmother is living,
the fact of her existence is appealed to: if there is
only a departed grandmother to remember, the maiden
is confronted with a ghost. That ghost is endowed
with as many excellences as those with which Miss
Betsey Trotwood endowed the niece that never had
been born; and, as David Copperfield was reproached
with the virtues of his unborn sister who “would never
have run away,” so that granddaughter with the headache
is reproached with the ghostly perfections of her
grandmother, who never had a headache—or, if she
had, it is luckily forgotten. It is necessary to ask,
sometimes, what was really the truth about our grandmothers?
Were they such models of bodily perfection
as is usually claimed?</p>

<p class='c014'>If we look at the early colonial days, we are at once
met by the fact, that although families were then often
larger than is now common, yet this phenomenon was
by no means universal, and was balanced by a good
many childless homes. Of this any one can satisfy
himself by looking over any family history; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>can also satisfy himself of the fact,—first pointed
out, I believe, by Mrs. Dall,—that third and fourth
marriages were then obviously and unquestionably
more common than now. The inference would seem
to be, that there is a little illusion about the health of
those days, as there is about the health of savage races.
In both cases, it is not so much that the average health
is greater under less highly civilized conditions, but
that these conditions kill off the weak, and leave only
the strong. Modern civilized society, on the other
hand, preserves the health of many men and women—and
permits them to marry, and become parents—who
under, the severities of savage life or of pioneer life
would have died, and given way to others.</p>

<p class='c014'>On this I will not dwell; because these good ladies
were not strictly our grandmothers, being farther removed.
But of those who were our grandmothers,—the
women of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary
epochs,—we happen to have very definite physiological
observations recorded; not very flattering, it is true, but
frank and searching. What these good women are in
the imagination of their descendants, we know. Mrs.
Stowe describes them as “the race of strong, hardy,
cheerful girls that used to grow up in country places,
and made the bright, neat New England kitchens of
olden times;” and adds, “This race of women, pride
of olden time, is daily lessening; and in their stead
come the fragile, easily-fatigued, languid girls of a
modern age, drilled in book-learning, ignorant of common
things.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What, now, was the testimony of those who saw our
grandmothers in the flesh? As it happens, there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>a good many foreigners, generally Frenchmen, who
came to visit the new Republic during the presidency
of Washington. Let us take, for instance, the testimony
of the two following.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Abbé Robin was a chaplain in Rochambeau’s
army during the Revolution, and wrote thus in regard
to the American ladies in his “Nouveau Voyage dans
l’Amérique Septentrionale,” published in 1782:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“They are tall and well-proportioned; their features are
generally regular; their complexions are generally fair and
without color.... At twenty years of age the women have
no longer the freshness of youth. At thirty-five or forty they
are wrinkled and decrepit. The men are almost as premature.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again: The Chevalier Louis Félix de Beaujour lived
in the United States from 1804 to 1814, as consul-general
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</span></i>; and wrote a book, immediately
after, which was translated into English under
the title, “A Sketch of the United States at the Commencement
of the Present Century.” In this he thus
describes American women:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“The women have more of that delicate beauty which belongs
to their sex, and in general have finer features and more
expression in their physiognomy. Their stature is usually tall,
and nearly all are possessed of a light and airy shape,—the
breast high, a fine head, and their color of a dazzling whiteness.
Let us imagine, under this brilliant form, the most modest demeanor,
a chaste and virginal air, accompanied by those single
and unaffected graces which flow from artless nature, and we
may have an idea of their beauty; but this beauty fades and
passes in a moment. At the age of twenty-five their form
changes, and at thirty the whole of their charms have disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>These statements bring out a class of facts, which, as
it seems to me, are singularly ignored by some of our
physiologists. They indicate that the modification of
the American type began early, and was, as a rule, due
to causes antedating the fashions or studies of the
present day. Here are our grandmothers and great-grandmothers
as they were actually seen by the eyes of
impartial or even flattering critics. These critics were
not Englishmen, accustomed to a robust and ruddy
type of women, but Frenchmen, used to a type more
like the American. They were not mere hasty travellers;
for the one lived here ten years, and the other
was stationed for some time at Newport, R.I., in a
healthy locality, noted in those days for the beauty of
its women. Yet we find it their verdict upon these
grandmothers of nearly a hundred years ago, that they
showed the same delicate beauty, the same slenderness,
the same pallor, the same fragility, the same early
decline, with which their granddaughters are now reproached.</p>

<p class='c014'>In some respects, probably, the physical habits of
the grandmothers were better: but an examination of
their portraits will satisfy any one that they laced more
tightly than their descendants, and wore their dresses
lower in the neck; and as for their diet, we have the
testimony of another French traveller, Volney, who was
in America from 1795 to 1798, that “if a premium
were offered for a regimen most destructive to the
teeth, the stomach, and the health in general, none
could be devised more efficacious for these ends than
that in use among this people.” And he goes on to
give particulars, showing a far worse condition in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>respect to cookery and diet than now prevails in any
decent American society.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have therefore strong evidence that the essential
change in the American type was effected in the last
century, not in this. Dr. E. H. Clarke says, “A century
does not afford a period long enough for the production
of great changes. That length of time could
not transform the sturdy German <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">fräulein</span></i> and robust
English damsel into the fragile American miss.” And
yet it is pretty clear that the first century and a half of
our colonial life had done just this for our grandmothers.
And, if so, our physiologists ought to conform their
theories to the facts.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PHYSIQUE OF AMERICAN WOMEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I was talking the other day with a New York physician,
long retired from practice, who after an absence
of a dozen years in Europe has returned within a year
to this country. He volunteered the remark, that nothing
had so impressed him since his return as the improved
health of Americans. He said that his wife
had been equally struck with it; and that they had
noticed it especially among the inhabitants of cities,
among the more cultivated classes, and in particular
among women.</p>

<p class='c014'>It so happened, that within twenty-four hours almost
precisely the same remark was made to me by another
gentleman of unusually cosmopolitan experience, and
past middle age. He further fortified himself by a
similar assertion made him by Charles Dickens, in comparing
his second visit to this country with his first.
In answer to an inquiry as to what points of difference
had most impressed him, Dickens said, “Your people,
especially the women, look better fed than formerly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is possible that in all these cases the witnesses
may have been led to exaggerate the original evil, while
absent from the country, and so may have felt some
undue re-action on their arrival. One of my informants
went so far as to say that he was confident that among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>his circle of friends in Boston and in London a dinnerparty
of half a dozen Americans would outweigh an
English party of the same number. Granting this to
be too bold a statement, and granting the unscientific
nature of all these assertions, they still indicate a
probability of their own truth until refuted by facts or
balanced by similar impressions on the other side.
They are further corroborated by the surprise expressed
by Huxley and some other recent Englishmen at finding
us a race more substantial than they had supposed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The truth seems to be, that Nature is endeavoring to
take a new departure in the American, and to produce
a race more finely organized, more sensitive, more
pliable, and of more nervous energy, than the races of
Northern Europe; that this change of type involves
some risk to health in the process, but promises greater
results whenever the new type shall be established. I
am confident that there has been within the last twenty
years a great improvement in the physical habits of the
more cultivated classes, at least, in this country,—better
food, better air, better habits as to bathing and exercise.
The great increase of athletic games; the greatly
increased proportion of seaside and mountain life in
summer; the thicker shoes and boots of women and
little girls, permitting them to go out more freely in all
weathers—these are among the permanent gains. The
increased habit of dining late, and of taking only a
lunch at noon, is of itself an enormous gain to the professional
and mercantile classes, because it secures time
for eating and for digestion. Even the furnaces in
houses, which seemed at first so destructive to the very
breath of life, turn out to have given a new lease to it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and open fires are being rapidly re-introduced as a provision
for enjoyment and health, when the main body
of the house has been tempered by the furnace. There
has been, furthermore, a decided improvement in the
bread of the community, and a very general introduction
of other farinaceous food. All this has happened
within my own memory, and gives <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a priori</span></i> probability
to the alleged improvement in physical condition within
twenty years.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, if these reasonings are still insufficient on the
one side, it must be remembered that the facts of the
census are almost equally inadequate when quoted on
the other. If, for instance, all the young people of a
New Hampshire village take a fancy to remove to Wisconsin,
it does not show that the race is dying out
because their children swell the birth-rate of Wisconsin
instead of New Hampshire. If in a given city the
births among the foreign-born population are twice as
many in proportion as among the American, we have
not the whole story until we learn whether the deaths
are not twice as many also. If so, the inference is, that
the same recklessness brought the children into the
world, and sent them out of it; and no physiological inference
whatever can be drawn. It was clearly established
by the medical commission of the Boston Board
of Health, a few years ago, that “the general mortality
of the foreign element is much greater than that of the
native element of our population.” “This is found
to be the case,” they add, “throughout the United
States as well as in Boston.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So far as I can judge, all our physiological tendencies
are favorable rather than otherwise: and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>transplantation of the English race seems now likely
to end in no deterioration, but in a type more finely
organized, and more comprehensive and cosmopolitan;
and this without loss of health, of longevity, or of
physical size and weight. And, if this is to hold true,
it must be true not only of men, but of women.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>IX.<br /> <span class='large'>“VERY MUCH FATIGUED.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The newspapers say that the Wyoming ladies, after
their first trial of jury-duty, looked very much fatigued.
Well, why not?</p>

<p class='c014'>Is it not the privilege of their sex to be fatigued?
Is it not commonly said to be one of their most becoming
traits? “The strength of womanhood lies in its
weakness,” and so on; and, if emancipation does not
destroy this lovely debility, it is not so bad, after all.
If a graceful languor is desirable, then the more of it
the better. Instead of the women’s coming out of the
jury-box like Amazons, they simply came out so many
tired women. They were not spoiled into strength,
but “very much fatigued.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In London or New York, now, this fatigue might
have come from six hours of piano-practice, from a
day’s shopping, from a night’s “German.” Then the
fatigue would be held to be charming and womanly.
But to aid in deciding on the guilt or innocence of a
fellow-creature, perhaps a fellow-woman,—is that the
only pursuit in which fatigue becomes disreputable?</p>

<p class='c014'>Consider at any rate that in Wyoming Territory these
more genteel and feminine forms of fatigue are as yet
rare. Pianos are doubtless scarce; in the shops whiskey
is the only thing not scarce; “Germans” are uncommon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>except in the shape of wandering miners who
are looking for other shafts than those of Cupid. Thus
cut off from city frivolities, may not the Wyoming ladies
be allowed for a while to tire themselves with something
useful? Let them have their court duties until good
society and “feminine” amusements arrive. Let them
at least be serviceable till they can be ornamental—as
the English member of Parliament declared that until
a man knew which way his interest went, he was justified
in temporarily voting according to his conscience.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very much fatigued?” How does jury-duty affect
men? Is there any thing against which they so fight
and struggle? It is recognized by the universal masculine
heart as the greatest bore known under civilization.
There is nothing which a man will not do in preference.
He will go to church twice on a Sunday, he will abjure
tobacco for a week, he will over-state his property to
the assessor, he will speak respectfully of Congress, he
will go without a daily newspaper, he will do any
self-devoted and unmasculine thing—if you will only
contrive in some way to leave him off the jury-list. If
these things are done in the dry tree, what shall be
done in the green? That which experienced men hate
with this consummation of all hatred, shall inexperienced
women endure without fatigue? It is wrong to
claim for them such unspeakable superiority.</p>

<p class='c014'>Look at a jury of men when they re-appear in court
after a long detention on a difficult case. What a set
of woe-begone wretches they are! What weary eyes,
what unkempt hair, what drooping and dilapidated
paper collars! Not all the tin wash-basins and soap,
not all the crackers and cheese, provided by the gentlemanly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sheriff, enable them to look any thing but “very
much fatigued.” Shall women look more forlorn than
these men? No: so long as women are women, they
will contrive during the most arduous jury duties to
“do up” their hair, they will come provided with
unseen relays of fresh cuffs and collars, and out of the
most unpromising court-room arrangements they will
concoct their cup of tea. Who has not noticed how
much better a railway detention or a prolonged trip
on a steamboat is borne, in appearance at least, by
the women than the men? Fatigued! How did the
jury-men look? Probably the jury-women, when they
bade his Honor the Judge good-morning, looked incomparably
fresher than their companions.</p>

<p class='c014'>At any rate, when we think what things women
endured that they might nurse our sick soldiers, how
they had to spend day and night where they might possibly
inhale tobacco, probably would hear swearing, and
certainly must brave dirt; when we think that they did
these things, and were only “very much fatigued,”—why
should we fear to risk them in a court-room?
Where there is wrong to be righted, innocence to be
vindicated, and guilt to be wisely dealt with,—there
make room for woman, and she will not shrink from
the fatigue. “For thee, fair justice! welcome all,”
as Sir William Blackstone remarked, when he stopped
being a poet and began to be a lawyer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>X.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LIMITATIONS OF SEX</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Are there any inevitable limitations of sex?</p>

<p class='c014'>Some reformers, apparently, think that there are not,
and that the best way to help woman is to deny the
fact of limitations. But I think the great majority of
reformers would take a different ground, and would
say that the two sexes are mutually limited by nature.
They would doubtless add that this very fact is an
argument for the enfranchisement of woman: for, if
woman is a mere duplicate of man, man can represent
her; but if she has traits of her own, absolutely distinct
from his, then he cannot represent her, and she
must have a voice and a vote of her own.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this last body of believers I belong. I think
that all legal or conventional obstacles should be
removed, which debar woman from determining for
herself, as freely as man determines, what the real
limitations of sex are, and what the merely conventional
restriction. But, when all is said and done,
there is no doubt that plenty of limitations will remain
on both sides.</p>

<p class='c014'>That man has his limitations, is clear. No matter
how finely organized a man may be, how sympathetic,
how tender, how loving, there is yet a barrier, never
to be passed, that separates the most precious part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the woman’s kingdom from him. All the wondrous
world of motherhood, with its unspeakable delights,
its holy of holies, remains forever unknown by him;
he may gaze, but never enter. That halo of pure devotion,
which makes a Madonna out of so many a poor
and ignorant woman, can never touch his brow. Many
a man loves children more than many a woman: but,
after all, it is not he who has borne them; to that
peculiar sacredness of experience he can never arrive.
But never mind whether the loss be a great one or a
small one: it is distinctly a limitation; and to every
loving mother it is a limitation so important that she
would be unable to weigh all the privileges and powers
of manhood against this peculiar possession of her
child.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, if this be true, and if man be thus distinctly
limited by the mere fact of sex, can the woman complain
that she also should have some natural limitations?
Grant that she should have no unnecessary
restrictions; and that the course of human progress is
constantly setting aside, as needless, point after point
that was once held essential. Still, if she finds—as
she undoubtedly will find—that natural barriers and
hindrances remain at last, and that she can no more do
man’s whole work in the world than he can do hers,
why should she complain? If he can accept his limitations,
she must be prepared also to accept hers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some of our physiological reformers declare that a
girl will be perfectly healthy if she can only be sensibly
dressed, and can “have just as much out-door
exercise as the boys, and of the same sort, if she
choose it.” But I have observed that matter a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>deal, and have watched the effect of boyish exercise
on a good many girls; and I am satisfied that so far
from being safely turned loose, as boys can be, they
need, for physical health, the constant supervision of
wise mothers. Otherwise the very exposure that only
hardens the boy may make the girl an invalid for life.
The danger comes from a greater sensitiveness of
structure,—not weakness, properly so called, since it
gives, in certain ways, more power of endurance,—a
greater sensitiveness which runs through all a woman’s
career, and is the expensive price she pays for the
divine destiny of motherhood. It is another natural
limitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>No wise person believes in any “reform against Nature,”
or that we can get beyond the laws of Nature.
If I believed the limitations of sex to be inconsistent
with woman suffrage for instance, I should oppose
this; but I do not see why a woman cannot form political
opinions by her baby’s cradle, as well as her husband
in his workshop, while her very love for the child
commits her to an interest in good government. Our
duty is to remove all the artificial restrictions we can.
That done, it will not be hard for man or woman to
acquiesce in the natural limitations.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE INVISIBLE LADY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Invisible Lady, as advertised in all our cities a
good many years ago, was a mysterious individual who
remained unseen, and had apparently no human organs
except a brain and a tongue. You asked questions of
her, and she made intelligent answers; but where she
was, you could no more discover than you could find
the man inside the Automaton Chess-Player. Was she
intended as a satire on womankind, or as a sincere representation
of what womankind should be? To many
men, doubtless, she would have seemed the ideal of her
sex, could only her brain and tongue have disappeared
like the rest of her faculties. Such men would have
liked her almost as well as that other mysterious personage
on the London sign-board, labelled “The Good
Woman,” and represented by a female figure without
a head.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not that any considerable portion of mankind
actually wishes to abolish woman from the universe.
But the opinion dies hard that she is best off when
least visible. These appeals which still meet us for
“the sacred privacy of woman” are only the Invisible
Lady on a larger scale. In ancient Bœotia, brides
were carried home in vehicles whose wheels were burned
at the door in token that they would never again be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>needed. In ancient Rome, it was a queen’s epitaph,
“She staid at home, and spun,”—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domum servavit,
lanum fecit</span></i>. In Turkey, not even the officers of justice
can enter the apartments of a woman without her
lord’s consent. In Spain and Spanish America, the veil
replaces the four walls of the house, and is a portable
seclusion. To be visible is at best a sign of peasant
blood and occupations; to be high-bred is to be invisible.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Azores I found that each peasant family endeavored
to secure for one or more of its daughters the
pride and glory of living unseen. The other sisters,
secure in innocence, tended cattle on lonely mountain-sides,
or toiled bare-legged up the steep ascents, their
heads crowned with orange-baskets. The chosen sister
was taught to read, to embroider, and to dwell indoors;
if she went out it was only under escort, and with her
face buried in a hood of almost incredible size, affording
only a glimpse of the poor pale cheeks, so unlike
the rosy vigor of the damsels on the mountain-side.
The girls, I was told, did not covet this privilege of
seclusion; but let us be genteel, or die.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now all that is left of the Invisible Lady among ourselves
is only the remnant of this absurd tradition. In
the seaside town where I write, ladies usually go veiled
in the streets, and so general is the practice that little
girls often veil their dolls. They all suppose it to be
done for complexion or for ornament; just as people
still hang straps on the backs of their carriages, not
knowing that it is a relic of the days when footmen
stood there and held on. But the veil represents a tradition
of seclusion, whether we know it or not; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the dread of hearing a woman speak in public, or of
seeing a woman vote, represents precisely the same
tradition. It is entitled to no less respect, and no more.</p>

<p class='c014'>Like all traditions, it finds something in human nature
to which to attach itself. Early girlhood, like early
boyhood, needs to be guarded and sheltered, that it
may mature unharmed. It is monstrous to make this
an excuse for keeping a woman, any more than a man,
in a condition of perpetual subordination and seclusion.
The young lover wishes to lock up his angel in a little
world of her own, where none may intrude. The harem
and the seraglio are simply the embodiment of this
desire. But the maturer man, and the maturer race,
have found that the beloved being should be something
more.</p>

<p class='c014'>After this discovery is made, the theory of the Invisible
Lady disappears. It is less of a shock to an
American to hear a woman speak in public than it is to
an Oriental to see her show her face in public at all.
Once open the door of the harem, and she has the freedom
of the house: the house includes the front door,
and the street is but a prolonged doorstep. With the
freedom of the street comes inevitably a free access to
the platform, the tribunal, and the pulpit. You might
as well try to stop the air in its escape from a punctured
balloon, as to try, when woman is once out of the harem,
to put her back there. Ceasing to be an Invisible Lady,
she must become a visible force: there is no middle
ground. There is no danger that she will not be anchored
to the cradle, when cradle there is; but it will
be by an elastic cable, that will leave her as free to
think and vote as to pray. No woman is less a mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>because she cares for all the concerns of the world into
which her child is born. It was John Quincy Adams
who said, defending the political petitions of the women
of Plymouth, that “women are not only justified, but
exhibit the most exalted virtue, when they do depart
from the domestic circle, and enter on the concerns of
their country, of humanity, and of their God.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XII.<br /> <span class='large'>SACRED OBSCURITY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the preface to that ill-named but delightful book,
the “Remains of the late Mrs. Richard Trench,” there
is a singular remark by the editor, her son. He says
that “the adage is certainly true in regard to the British
matron, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bene vixit quæ bene latuit</span></i>,” the meaning of this
adage being, “She has lived well who has kept herself
well out of sight.” Applying this to his beloved mother,
he further expresses a regret at disturbing her “sacred
obscurity.” Then he goes on to disturb it pretty effectually
by printing a thick octavo volume of her most
private letters.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a great source of strength and advantage to
reformers, that there are always men preserved to be
living examples of this good old Oriental doctrine of
“sacred obscurity.” Just as Mr. Darwin needs for
the demonstration of his theory that the lower orders
of creation should still be present in visible form for
purposes of comparison, so every reformer needs to
fortify his position by showing examples of the original
attitude from which society has been gradually
emerging. If there had been no Oriental seclusion,
many things in the present position of woman would
be inexplicable. But when we point to that; when we
show that even in the more enlightened Eastern countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>it is still held indecorous to allude to the feminine
members of a man’s family; when we see among the
Christian nations of Southern Europe many lingering
traits of this same habit of seclusion; and when we
find an archdeacon of the English Church still clinging
to the theory, even while exhibiting his mother’s family
letters to the whole world,—we more easily understand
the course of development.</p>

<p class='c014'>These re-assertions of the Oriental theory are simply
reversions, as a naturalist would say, to the original
type. They are instances of “atavism,” like the occasional
appearance of six fingers on one hand in a
family where the great-great-grandfather happened to
possess that ornament. Such instances can always be
found, when one takes the pains to look for them.
Thus a critic, discussing in the Atlantic Monthly Mr.
Mahaffy’s book on “Social Life in Greece,” is surprised
that this writer should quote, in proof of the
degradation of woman in Athens, the remark attributed
to Pericles, “That woman is best who is least spoken
of among men, whether for good or for evil.” “In
our opinion,” adds the reviewer, “that remark was
wise then, and is wise now.” The Oriental theory is
not then, it seems, extinct; and we are spared the
pains of proving that it ever existed.</p>

<p class='c014'>If this theory be true, how falsely has the admiration
of mankind been given! If the most obscure woman
is best, the most conspicuous must undoubtedly be
worst. Tried by this standard, how unworthy must
have been Elizabeth Barrett Browning, how reprehensible
must be Dorothea Dix, what a model of all that
is discreditable is Rosa Bonheur, what a crowning instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of human depravity is Florence Nightingale!
Yet how consoling the thought, that, while these disreputable
persons were thus wasting their substance in
the riotous performance of what the world weakly styled
good deeds, there were always women who saw the
folly of such efforts, women who by steady devotion to
eating, drinking, and sleeping continued to keep themselves
in sacred obscurity, and to prove themselves the
ornaments of their sex, inasmuch as no human being
ever had occasion to mention their names!</p>

<p class='c014'>But alas for human inconsistency! As for this inverse-ratio
theory,—this theory of virtue so exalted
that it has never been known or felt or mentioned
among men,—it is to be observed that those who hold
it are the first to desert it when stirred by an immediate
occasion. Just as a slaveholder, in the old times,
after demonstrating to you that freedom was a curse
to the negro, would instantly turn round, and inflict
this greatest of all curses on some slave who had saved
his life; so, I fear, would one of these philosophers, if
he were profoundly impressed with any great action
done by a woman, give the lie to all his theories, and
celebrate her fame. In spite of all his fine principles,
if he happened to be rescued from drowning by Grace
Darling, he would put her name in the newspaper; if
he were tended in hospital by Clara Barton, he would
sound her praise; and, if his mother wrote as good
letters as did Mrs. Trench, he would probably print
them to the extent of five hundred pages, as the archdeacon
did, and all his gospel of silence would exhale
itself in a single sigh of regret in the preface.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>“OUR TRIALS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A Providence (R.I.) newspaper remarked some
time since that Mrs. Livermore had just delivered in
Newport her celebrated lecture, “What shall we do
with our Trials?” It was, I suppose, one of those
felicitous misprints, by which compositors build better
than they know. The real title of the lecture was,
“What shall we do with our Girls?” Perhaps it was
the unconscious witticism of some poetic young typesetter,
to whom damsels were as yet only pleasing
pains; or of some premature cynic of the printing-office,
who was in the habit of regarding himself as a
Blighted Being.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet to how many is this morose phrase “humanly
adaptive,” as Mrs. Browning abstrusely says! Anxious
mothers, for instance, will accept it, the mothers
of the thousands of surplus maidens—or whatever the
statistics say—in Massachusetts. Frederica Bremer
inserts in one of her novels an “Extra Leaf on Daughter-full
Houses;” an extra that should have a large
circulation in many towns of New England. The
most heroic and unflinching remedy for this class of
trials, so far as my knowledge goes, was that announced
by a small relative of my own, aged three,
who sitting on the floor thus soliloquized to her doll:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“If I had too many daughters, I’d take ’em into the
woods and lose ’em—I’d take ’em to the sea and push
’em in: I wouldn’t have too many daughters!” She
is now a happy wife and mother; but Fate, warned in
time by such exceeding plainness of speech, has judiciously
endowed her chiefly with sons.</p>

<p class='c014'>Most of the serious assertion that women are trials
comes from masculine wisdom. One hears a good deal
of it in summer, at the seaside, from the marriageable
youth of some of our chief cities. After a languid
hour’s chat upon tailors or boots or the proper appointments
of a harness,—or of the groom, so perfectly
costumed that he seems but a part of the harness,—how
often they fall to lamenting the extravagance,
the exactions, the general unmarriageableness, of the
young women of the present day! Some wit once
said that the Pilgrim Mothers had much more to bear
than the Pilgrim Fathers, since the Mothers had not
only to endure the cold and the hunger, but to endure
the Fathers beside. In hearing these remarks I have
sometimes thought that these young ladies must be
extravagant indeed, if, in addition to their own expenses,
they take to themselves so very costly a luxury
as a fashionable husband.</p>

<p class='c014'>And I think that wiser critics than these youths
are sometimes tempted into treating these lovely and
lovable “trials” in too severely hopeless a way.
There is folly enough on the surface, no doubt, and
something of it below the surface: yet who does
not remember how, in time of need, all these follies
proved themselves, during our civil war, but superficial
things? The very maidens over whom we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>shaken our anxious heads were suddenly those who
with pale cheeks bade their lovers leave them, or who
changed their gorgeous array for the plain garments
of the hospital. So far as I can judge, there is not a
young girl within the range of my knowledge who can
confidently be insured against marrying a poor artist
or a poorer army officer to-morrow, should she once
fall thoroughly in love. And, once married, she will
very probably develop a power of self-denial, of economy,
and of dressing herself and baby gracefully out
of the cast-off clothes of her genteel relations,—in
a way to put her critics to shame. I think we ought all
patiently to endure “trials” that turn to such blessings
in the end.</p>

<p class='c014'>For one, I can truly say, with charming Mrs. Trench
in her letters written in 1816, “I do believe the girls
of the present day have not lost the power of blushing;
and, though I have no grown-up daughters, I enjoy
the friendship of some who might be my daughters,
in whom the greatest delicacy and modesty are united
with perfect ease of manner, and habitual intercourse
with the world.” And if this is the case,—and I think
we shall all own it to be so,—we may as well have
the typographical error corrected, after all, and hereafter
say—for “trials” read “girls.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>VIRTUES IN COMMON.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A young friend of mine, who was educated at one of
the very best schools for girls in New York City, told
me that one day her teacher requested the older girls
to write out a list of virtues suitable to manly character,
which they did. A month or more later, when this
occurrence was well forgotten, the same teacher bade
them write out a list of womanly virtues, she making
no reference to the other list. Then she made each
girl compare her lists; and they all found with surprise
that there was no substantial difference between them.
The only variation, in most cases, was, that they had
put in a rather vague special virtue of “manliness”
in the one case, and “womanliness” in the other; a
sort of miscellaneous department or “odd drawer,” apparently,
in which to group all traits not easily analyzed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The moral is, that, as tested by the common-sense
of these young people, duty is duty, and the difference
between ethics for men and ethics for women lies simply
in practical applications, not in principles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Who can deny that the philosopher Antisthenes was
right when he said, “The virtues of the man and the
woman are the same”? Not the Christian, certainly;
for he accepts as his highest standard the being who
in all history best united the highest qualities of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>sexes. Not the metaphysician; for his analysis deals
with the human mind as such, not with the mind of
either sex. Not the evolutionist; for he is accustomed
to trace back qualities to their source, and cannot deny
that there is in each sex at least a “survival” of every
good and every bad trait. We may say that these
qualities are, or may be, or ought to be, distributed
unequally between the sexes; but we cannot reasonably
deny that each sex possesses a share of every quality,
and that what is good in one sex is also good in the
other. Man may be the braver, and yet courage in a
woman may be nobler than cowardice. Woman may
be the purer, and yet purity may be noble in a man.</p>

<p class='c014'>So clear is this, that some of the very coarsest writers
in all literature, and those who have been severest
upon women, have yet been obliged to acknowledge it.
Take, for instance, Dean Swift, who writes:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“I am ignorant of any one quality that is amiable in a
woman, which is not equally so in a man. I do not except
even modesty and gentleness of nature; nor do I know one
vice or folly which is not equally detestable in both.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Jameson, in her delightful “Commonplace
Book,” illustrates this admirably by one or two test
cases. She takes, for instance, from one of Humboldt’s
letters a much-admired passage on manly character:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Masculine independence of mind I hold to be in reality
the first requisite for the formation of a character of real
manly worth. The man who allows himself to be deceived
and carried away by his own weakness, may be a very amiable
person in other respects, but cannot be called a good man:
such beings should not find favor in the eyes of a woman, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>a truly beautiful and purely feminine nature should be attracted
only by what is highest and noblest in the character
of man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take now this same bit of moral philosophy,” she
says, “and apply it to the feminine character, and it
reads quite as well:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“‘Feminine independence of mind I hold to be in reality the
first requisite for the formation of a character of real feminine
worth. The woman who allows herself to be deceived and
carried away by her own weakness, may be a very amiable
person in other respects, but cannot be called a good woman;
such beings should not find favor in the eyes of a man, for a
truly beautiful and purely manly nature should be attracted only
by what is highest and noblest in the character of woman.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>I have never been able to perceive that there was
a quality or grace of character which really belonged
exclusively to either sex, or which failed to win honor
when wisely exercised by either. It is not thought
necessary to have separate editions of books on ethical
science, the one for man, the other for woman, like
almanacs calculated for different latitudes. The books
that vary are not the scientific works, but little manuals
of practical application,—“Duties of Men,” “Duties
of Women.” These vary with times and places: where
women do not know how to read, no advice on reading
will be found in the women’s manuals; where it is held
wrong for women to uncover the face, it will be laid
down in these manuals as a sin. But ethics are ethics:
the great principles of morals, as proclaimed either by
science or by religion, do not fluctuate for sex; their
basis is in the very foundations of right itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>This grows clearer when we remember that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>equally true in mental science. There is not one logic
for men, and another for women; a separate syllogism,
a separate induction: the moment we begin to state
intellectual principles, that moment we go beyond sex.
We deal then with absolute truth. If an observation
is wrong, if a process of reasoning is bad, it makes no
difference who brings it forward. Any list of mental
processes, any inventory of the contents of the mind,
would be identical, so far as sex goes, whether compiled
by a woman or a man. These things, like the circulation
of the blood or the digestion of food, belong clearly
to the ground held in common. The London Spectator
well said lately,—</p>

<p class='c021'>“After all, knowledge is knowledge; and there is no more
a specifically feminine way of describing correctly the origin of
the Lollard movement, or the character of Spenser’s poetry,
than there is a specifically feminine way of solving a quadratic
equation, or of proving the forty-seventh problem of Euclid’s
first book.”</p>

<p class='c014'>All we can say in modification of this is, that there
is, after all, a foundation for the rather vague item
of “manliness” and “womanliness” in these schoolgirl
lists of duties. There is a difference, after all is
said and done; but it is something that eludes analysis,
like the differing perfume of two flowers of the same
genus and even of the same species. The method of
thought must be essentially the same in both sexes; and
yet an average woman will put more flavor of something
we call instinct into her mental action, and the
average man something more of what we call logic into
his. Whipple tells us that not a man guessed the
plot of Dickens’s “Great Expectations,” while many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>women did; and this certainly indicates some average
difference of quality or method. So the average opinions
of a hundred women, on some question of ethics, might
very probably differ from the average of a hundred men,
while yet it remains true that “the virtues of the man
and the woman are the same.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XV.<br /> <span class='large'>INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Blackburn, in his entertaining book, “Artists and
Arabs,” draws a contrast between Frith’s painting of
the “Derby Day” and Rosa Bonheur’s “Horse Fair,”—“the
former pleasing the eye by its cleverness and
prettiness, the latter impressing the spectator by its
power and its truthful rendering of animal life. The
difference between the two painters is probably more
one of education than of natural gifts. But, whilst the
style of the former is grafted on a fashion, the latter
is founded on a rock,—the result of a close study of
nature, chastened by classic feeling and a remembrance,
it may be, of the friezes of the Parthenon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, it is to be observed that this description runs
precisely counter to the popular impression as to the
work of the two sexes. Novelists like Charles Reade,
for instance, who have apparently seen precisely one
woman in their lives, and hardly more than one man,
and who keep on sketching these two figures most
felicitously and brilliantly thenceforward, would be apt
to assign these qualities of the artist very differently.
Their typical man would do the truthful and powerful
work, and everybody would say, “How manly!”
Their woman would please by cleverness and prettiness,
and everybody would say, “How womanly!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Yet Blackburn shows us that these qualities are individual,
not sexual; that they result from temperament,
or, he thinks, still more from training. If Rosa
Bonheur does better work than Frith, it is not because
she is a woman, nor is it in spite of that; but because,
setting sex aside, she is a better artist.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is not denying the distinctions of sex, but only
asserting that they are not so exclusive and all-absorbing
as is supposed. It is easy to name other grounds
of difference which entirely ignore those of sex, striking
directly across them, and rendering a different
classification necessary. It is thus with distinctions
of race or color, for instance. An Indian man and
woman are at many points more like to one another
than is either to a white person of the same sex. A
black-haired man and woman, or a fair-haired man and
woman, are to be classified together in these physiological
aspects. So of differences of genius: a man
and woman of musical temperament and training have
more in common than has either with a person who is
of the same sex, but who cannot tell one note from
another. So two persons of ardent or imaginative
temperament are thus far alike, though the gulf of sex
divides them; and so are two persons of cold or prosaic
temperament. In a mixed school the teacher cannot
class together intellectually the boys as such, and
the girls as such: bright boys take hold of a lesson
very much as bright girls do, and slow girls like slow
boys. Nature is too rich, too full, too varied, to be
content with a single basis of classification: she has
a hundred systems of grouping, according to sex, age,
race, temperament, training, and so on; and we get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>but a narrow view of life when we limit our theories
to one set of distinctions.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a matter of social philosophy, this train of thought
logically leads to co-education, impartial suffrage, and
free co-operation in all the affairs of life. As a matter
of individual duty, it teaches the old moral to “act
well your part.” No wise person will ever trouble
himself or herself much about the limitations of sex in
intellectual labor. Rosa Bonheur was not trying to
work like a woman, or like a man, or unlike either, but
to do her work thoroughly and well. He or she who
works in this spirit works nobly, and gives an example
which will pass beyond the bounds of sex, and help
all. The Abbé Liszt, the most gifted of living pianists,
told a friend of mine, his pupil, that he had learned
more of music from hearing Madame Malibran sing,
than from any thing else whatever.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>ANGELIC SUPERIORITY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is better not to base any plea for woman on
the ground of her angelic superiority. The argument
proves too much. If she is already so perfect, there
is every inducement to let well alone. It suggests the
expediency of conforming man’s condition to hers, instead
of conforming hers to man’s. If she is a winged
creature, and man can only crawl, it is his condition
that needs mending.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides, one may well be a little incredulous of these
vast claims. Granting some average advantage to
woman, it is not of such completeness as to base much
argument upon it. The minister looking on his congregation,
rarely sees an unmixed angel, either at the
head or at the foot of any pew. The domestic servant
rarely has the felicity of waiting on an absolute saint
at either end of the dinner-table. The lady’s-maid has
to compare her little observations of human infirmity
with those of the valet-de-chambre. The lover worships
the beloved, whether man or woman; but marriage
bears rather hard on the ideal in either case. And
those who pray out of the same book, “Have mercy
upon us, miserable sinners,” are not supposed to be
offering up petitions for each other only.</p>

<p class='c014'>We all know many women whose lives are made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>wretched by the sins and follies of their husbands.
There are also many men whose lives are turned to
long wretchedness by the selfishness, the worldliness,
or the bad temper of their wives. Domestic tyranny
belongs to neither sex by monopoly. If man tortures
or depresses woman, she also has a fearful power to
corrupt and deprave man. On the other hand, to
quote old Antisthenes once more, “the virtues of the
man and woman are the same.” A refined man is more
refined than a coarse woman. A child-loving man is
infinitely tenderer and sweeter toward children than a
hard and unsympathetic woman. The very qualities
that are claimed as distinctively feminine are possessed
more abundantly by many men than by many of what
is called the softer sex.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why is it necessary to say all this? Because there
is always danger that we who believe in the equality of
the sexes should be led into over-statements, which
will re-act against ourselves. It is not safe to say that
the ballot-box would be reformed if intrusted to feminine
votes alone. Had the voters of the South been
all women, it would have plunged earlier into the gulf
of secession, dived deeper, and come up even more
reluctantly. Were the women of Spain to rule its destinies
unchecked, the Pope would be its master, and
the Inquisition might be re-established. For all that
we can see, the rule of women alone would be as bad
as the rule of men alone. It would be as unsafe to
give woman the absolute control of man as to make
man the master of woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us be a shade more cautious in our reasonings.
Woman needs equal rights, not because she is man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>better half, but because she is his other half. She
needs them, not as an angel, but as a fraction of
humanity. Her political education will not merely
help man, but it will help herself. She will sometimes
be right in her opinions, and sometimes be altogether
wrong; but she will learn, as man learns, by her own
blunders. The demand in her behalf is, that she shall
have the opportunity to make mistakes, since it is by
that means she must become wise.</p>

<p class='c014'>In all our towns, there is a tendency toward “mixed
schools.” We rarely hear of the sexes being separated
in a school after being once united; but we constantly
hear of their being brought together after separation.
This is commonly, but mistakenly, recommended as an
advantage to the boys alone. I once heard an accomplished
teacher remonstrate against this change, when
thus urged. “Why should my girls be sacrificed,”
she said, “to improve your boys?” Six months after,
she had learned by experience. “Why,” she asked,
“did you rest the argument on so narrow a ground?
Since my school consisted half of boys, I find with surprise
that the change has improved both sexes. My
girls are more ambitious, more obedient, and more
ladylike. I shall never distrust the policy of mixed
schools again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What is true of the school is true of the family and
of the state. It is not good for man, or for woman,
to be alone. Granting the woman to be, on the whole,
the more spiritually minded, it is still true that each sex
needs the other. When the rivet falls from a pair of
scissors, we do not have them mended because either
half can claim angelic superiority over the other half,
but because it takes two halves to make a whole.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>VICARIOUS HONORS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is a story in circulation—possibly without
authority—to the effect that a certain young lady has
ascended so many Alps that she would have been
chosen a member of the English Alpine Club, but for
her misfortune in respect to sex. As a matter of personal
recognition, however, and, as it were, of approximate
courtesy, her dog, who has accompanied her in
all her trips, and is not debased by sex, has been
elected into the club. She has therefore an opportunity
for exercising in behalf of her dog that beautiful
self-abnegation which is said to be a part of woman’s
nature, impelling her always to prefer that her laurels
should be worn by somebody else.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dog probably made no objection to these vicarious
honors; nor is any objection made by the young
gentlemen who reply eloquently to the toast, “The
Ladies” at public dinners, or who kindly consent to
be educated at masculine colleges on “scholarships”
founded by women. At Harvard University alone there
are ten such scholarships,—their income amounting
annually to $2,340 in all. Those who receive the
emoluments of these funds must reflect within themselves,
occasionally, how grand a thing is this power
of substitution given to women, and how pleasant are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>its occasional results to the substitute. It is doubtless
more blessed to give than to receive, but to receive
without giving has also its pleasures. Very likely the
holder of the scholarship, and the orator who rises
with his hand on his heart to “reply in behalf of the
ladies,” may do their appointed work well; and so did
the Alpine dog. Yet, after all, but for the work done
by his mistress, he would have won no more honor
from the Alpine Club than if he had been a chamois.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing since Artemus Ward and his wife’s relations
has been finer than the generous way in which
fathers and brothers disclaim all desire for profits or
honors on the part of their feminine relatives. In a
certain system of schools once known to me, the boys
had prizes of money on certain occasions, but the successful
girls at those times received simply a testimonial
of honor for each; “the committee being convinced,”
it was said, “that this was more consonant
with the true delicacy and generosity of woman’s nature.”
So in the new arrangements for opening the
University of Copenhagen to young women, Karl Blind
writes to the New York Evening Post, that it is expressly
provided that they shall not “share in the
academic benefices and stipends which have been set
apart for male students.” Half of these charities
may, for aught that appears, have been established
originally by women, like the ten Harvard scholarships
already named. Women, however, can avail themselves
of them only by deputy, as the Alp-climbing
young lady is represented by her dog.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is all a beautiful tribute to the disinterestedness
of woman. The only pity is that this virtue, so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>admired, should not be reciprocated by showing the
like disinterestedness toward her. It does not appear
that the butchers and bakers of Copenhagen propose
to reduce in the case of women students “the benefices
and stipends” which are to be paid for daily
food. Young ladies at the university are only prohibited
from receiving money, not from needing it.
Nor will any of the necessary fatigues of Alpine
climbing be relaxed for any young lady because she
is a woman. The fatigues will remain in full force,
though the laurels be denied. The mountain-passes
will make small account of the “tenderness and delicacy
of her sex.” When the toil is over she will be
regarded as too delicate to be thanked for it; but, by
way of compensation, the Alpine Club will allow her
to be represented by her dog.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE GOSPEL OF HUMILIATION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The silliest man who ever lived,” wrote Fanny
Fern once, “has always known enough, when he says
his prayers, to thank God he was not born a woman.”
President —— of —— College is not a silly man at all,
and he is devoting his life to the education of women;
yet he seems to feel as vividly conscious of his superior
position as even Fanny Fern could wish. If he had
been born a Jew, he would have thanked God, in the
appointed ritual, for not having made him a woman.
If he had been a Mohammedan, he would have accepted
the rule which forbids “a fool, a madman, or a woman”
to summon the faithful to prayer. Being a Christian
clergyman, with several hundred immortal souls, clothed
in female bodies, under his charge, he thinks it his duty,
at proper intervals, to notify his young ladies, that,
though they may share with men the glory of being
sophomores, they still are in a position, as regards the
other sex, of hopeless subordination. This is the climax
of his discourse, which in its earlier portions contains
many good and truthful things:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“And, as the woman is different from the man, so is she
relative to him. This is true on the other side also. They are
bound together by mutual relationship so intimate and vital
that the existence of neither is absolutely complete except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with reference to the other. But there is this difference, that
the relation of woman is, characteristically, that of subordination
and dependence. This does not imply inferiority of
character, of capacity, of value, in the sight of God or man;
and it has been the glory of woman to have accepted the position
of formal inferiority assigned her by the Creator, with all
its responsibilities, its trials, its possible outward humiliations
and sufferings, in the proud consciousness that it is not incompatible
with an essential superiority; that it does not
prevent her from occupying, if she will, an inward elevation
of character, from which she may look down with pitying and
helpful love on him she calls her lord. Jesus said, ‘Ye know
that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,
and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it
shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among
you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief
among you, let him be your servant, even as the Son of man
came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
his life a ransom for many.’ Surely woman need not hesitate
to estimate her status by a criterion of dignity sustained by
such authority. She need not shrink from a position which
was sought by the Son of God, and in whose trials and griefs
she will have his sympathy and companionship.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a comforting aspect to this discourse, after
all. It holds out the hope, that a particularly noble
woman may not be personally inferior to a remarkably
bad husband, but “may look down with pitying and
helpful love on him she calls her lord.” The drawback
is not merely that it insults woman by a reassertion
of a merely historical inferiority, which is
steadily diminishing, but that it fortifies this by precisely
the same talk about the dignity of subordination
which has been used to buttress every oppression since
the world began. Never yet was there a pious slaveholder
who did not quote to his slaves, on Sunday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>precisely the same texts with which President ——
favors his meek young pupils. Never yet was there a
slaveholder who would not shoot through the head, if
he had courage enough, anybody who should attempt
to place him in that beautiful position of subjection
whose spiritual merits he had been proclaiming. When
it came to that, he was like Thoreau, who believed
resignation to be a virtue, but preferred “not to practise
it unless it was quite necessary.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, when the Rev. Charles C. Jones of Savannah
used to address the slaves on their condition, he proclaimed
the beauty of obedience in a way to bring tears
to their eyes. And this, he frankly assures the masters,
is the way to check insurrection and advance their
own “pecuniary interests.” He says of the slave,
that under proper religious instruction “his conscience
is enlightened and his soul is awed;&nbsp;... to God he
commits the ordering of his lot, and in his station
renders to all their dues, obedience to whom obedience,
and honor to whom honor. <em>He dares not wrest from
God his own care and protection.</em> While he sees a preference
in the various conditions of men, he remembers
the words of the apostle: ‘Art thou called being a
servant? Care not for it; but, if thou mayst be free,
use it rather. For he that is called in the Lord, being
a servant, is the Lord’s freeman; likewise, also, he
that is called being free, is Christ’s servant.’”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>I must say that the Rev. Mr. Jones’s preaching
seems to me precisely as good as Dr. ——’s, and that a
sensible woman ought to be as much influenced by the
one as was Frederick Douglass by the other—that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>not at all. Let the preacher try “subordination” himself,
and see how he likes it. The beauty of service,
such as Jesus praised, lay in the willingness of the
service: a service that is serfdom loses all beauty,
whether rendered by man or by woman. My objection
to separate schools and colleges for women is, that they
are too apt to end in such instructions as this.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>“CELERY AND CHERUBS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There was once a real or imaginary old lady who
had got the metaphor of Scylla and Charybdis a little
confused. Wishing to describe a perplexing situation,
this lady said,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see, my dear, she was between Celery on one
side and Cherubs on the other! You know about Celery
and Cherubs, don’t you? They was two rocks somewhere;
and if you didn’t hit one, you was pretty sure
to run smack on the other.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This describes, as a clever writer in the New York
Tribune declares, the present condition of women who
“agitate.” Their Celery and Cherubs are tears and
temper.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a good hit, and we may well make a note of it.
It is the danger of all reformers, that they will vibrate
between discouragement and anger. When things go
wrong, what is it one’s impulse to do? To be cast
down, or to be stirred up; to wring one’s hands, or
clench one’s fists,—in short, tears or temper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother,” said a resolute little girl of my acquaintance,
“if the dinner was all spoiled, I wouldn’t sit
down, and cry! I’d say, ‘Hang it!’” This cherub
preferred the alternative of temper, on days when the
celery turned out badly. Probably her mother was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>addicted to the other practice, and exhibited the
tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>But as this alternative is found to exist for both
sexes, and on all occasions, why charge it especially
on the woman-suffrage movement? Men are certainly
as much given to ill temper as women; and, if they
are less inclined to tears, they make it up in sulks,
which are just as bad. Nicholas Nickleby, when the
pump was frozen, was advised by Mr. Squeers to
“content himself with a dry polish;” and so there is a
kind of dry despair into which men fall, which is quite
as forlorn as any tears of women. How many a man
has doubtless wished at such times that the pump of
his lachrymal glands could only thaw out, and he could
give his emotions something more than a “dry polish”!
The unspeakable comfort some women feel in sitting
for ten minutes with a handkerchief over their eyes!
The freshness, the heartiness, the new life visible in
them, when the crying is done, and the handkerchief
comes down again!</p>

<p class='c014'>And, indeed, this simple statement brings us to the
real truth, which should have been more clearly seen
by the writer who tells this story. She is wrong in
saying, “It is urged that men and women stand on
an equality, are exactly alike.” Many of us urge the
“equality:” very few of us urge the “exactly alike.”
An apple and an orange, a potato and a tomato, a rose
and a lily, the Episcopal and the Presbyterian churches,
Oxford and Cambridge, Yale and Harvard,—we may
surely grant equality in each case, without being so
exceedingly foolish as to go on and say that they are
exactly alike.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>And precisely here is the weak point of the whole
case, as presented by this writer. Women give way
to tears more readily than men? Granted. Is their
sex any the weaker for it? Not a bit. It is simply a
difference of temperament: that is all. It involves no
inferiority. If you think that this habit necessarily
means weakness, wait and see! Who has not seen
women break down in tears during some domestic calamity,
while the “stronger sex” were calm; and who
has not seen those same women, that temporary excitement
being over, rise up and dry their eyes, and be
thenceforth the support and stay of their households,
and perhaps bear up the “stronger sex” as a stream
bears up a ship? I said once to an experienced physician,
watching such a woman, “That woman is really
great.”—“Of course she is,” he answered: “did you
ever see a woman who was not great, when the emergency
required?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, will women carry this same quality of temperament
into their public career? Doubtless: otherwise
they would cease to be women. Will it be betraying
confidence if I own that I have seen two of the very
bravest women of my acquaintance—women who have
swayed great audiences—burst into tears, during a
committee-meeting, at a moment of unexpected adversity
for “the cause”? How pitiable! our critical observers
would have thought. In five minutes that April
shower had passed, and those women were as resolute
and unconquerable as Queen Elizabeth: they were again
the natural leaders of those around them; and the cool
and tearless men who sat beside them were nothing—men
were “a lost art,” as some one says—compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>with the inexhaustible moral vitality of those two
women.</p>

<p class='c014'>No: the dangers of “Celery and Cherubs” are exaggerated.
For temper, women are as good as men,
and no better. As for tears, long may they flow!
They are symbols of that mighty distinction of sex
which is as ineffaceable and as essential as the difference
between land and sea.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE NEED OF CAVALRY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the interesting Buddhist book, “The Wheel of
the Law,” translated by Henry Alabaster, there is an
account of a certain priest who used to bless a great
king, saying, “May your majesty have the firmness of
a crow, the audacity of a woman, the endurance of a
vulture, and the strength of an ant.” The priest then
told anecdotes illustrating all of these qualities. Who
has not known occasions wherein some daring woman
has been the Joan of Arc of a perfectly hopeless cause,
taken it up where men shrank, carried it through where
they had failed, and conquered by weapons which men
would never have thought of using, and would have
lacked faith to employ even if put into their hands?
The wit, the resources, the audacity of women, have
been the key to history and the staple of novels, ever
since that larger novel called history began to be
written.</p>

<p class='c014'>How is it done? Who knows the secret of their
success? All that any man can say is, that the heart
enters largely into the magic. Rogers asserts in his
“Table-Talk,” that often, when doubting how to act
in matters of importance, he had received more useful
advice from women than from men. “Women have
the understanding of the heart,” he said, “which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>better than that of the head.” Then this instinct, that
begins from the heart, reaches the heart also, and
through that controls the will. “Win hearts,” said
Lord Burleigh to Queen Elizabeth, “and you have
hands and purses;” and the greatest of English sovereigns,
in spite of ugliness and rouge, in spite of
coarseness and cruelty and bad passions, was adored
by the nation that she first made great.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems to me that women are a sort of cavalry force
in the army of mankind. They are not always to be
relied upon for that steady “hammering away,” which
was Grant’s one method; but there is a certain Sheridan
quality about them, light-armed, audacious, quick,
irresistible. They go before the main army; their
swift wits go scouting far in advance; they are the first
to scent danger, or to spy out chances of success.
Their charge is like that of a Tartar horde, or the wild
sweep of the Apaches. They are upon you from some
wholly unexpected quarter; and this respectable, systematic,
well-drilled masculine force is caught and rolled
over and over in the dust, before the man knows what
has hit him. But, even if repelled and beaten off, this
formidable cavalry is unconquered: routed and in confusion
to-day, it comes back upon you to-morrow—fresh,
alert, with new devices, bringing new dangers.
In dealing with it, as the French complained of the
Arabs in Algiers, “Peace is not to be purchased by
victory.” And, even if all seems lost, with what a
brilliant final charge it will cover a retreat!</p>

<p class='c014'>Decidedly, we need cavalry. In older countries,
where it has been a merely undisciplined and irregular
force, it has often done mischief; and public men, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Demosthenes down, have been lamenting that measures
which the statesman has meditated a whole year, may
be overturned in a day by a woman. Under our American
government we have foolishly attempted to leave
out this arm of the service altogether; and much of
the alleged dulness of our American history has come
from this attempt. Those who have been trained in
the various reforms where woman has taken an equal
part—the anti-slavery reform especially—know well
how much of the energy, the dash, the daring, of those
movements, have come from her. A revolution with a
woman in it is stronger than the established order that
omits her. It is not that she is superior to man, but
she is different from man; and we can no more spare
her than we could spare the cavalry from an army.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>“THE REASON FIRM, THE TEMPERATE WILL.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is a part of the necessary theory of republican
government, that every class and race shall be judged
by its highest types, not its lowest. The proposition
of the French revolutionary statesman, to begin the
work of purifying the world by arresting all the cowards
and knaves, is liable to the objection that it would find
victims in every circle. Republican government begins
at the other end, and assumes that the community generally
has good intentions at least, and some common
sense, however it may be with individuals. Take the
very quality which the newspapers so often deny to
women,—the quality of steadiness. “In fact, men’s
great objection to the entrance of the female mind into
politics is drawn from a suspicion of its unsteadiness
on matters in which the feelings could by any possibility
be enlisted.” Thus says the New York Nation. Let
us consider this implied charge against women, and
consider it not by generalizing from a single instance,—“just
like a woman,” as the editors would doubtless
say, if a woman had done it,—but by observing whole
classes of that sex, taken together.</p>

<p class='c014'>These classes need some care in selection, for the
plain reason that there are comparatively few circles
in which women have yet been allowed enough freedom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of scope, or have acted sufficiently on the same plane
with men, to furnish a fair estimate of their probable
action, were they enfranchised. Still there occur to
me three such classes,—the anti-slavery women, the
Quaker women, and the women who conduct philanthropic
operations in our large cities. If the alleged
unsteadiness of women is to be felt in public affairs, it
would have been felt in these organizations. Has it
been so felt?</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the anti-slavery movement I can personally testify,—and
I have heard the same point fully recognized
among my elders, such as Garrison, Phillips, and Quincy,—that
the women contributed their full share, if not
more than their share, to the steadiness of that movement,
even in times when the feelings were most excited,
as, for instance, in fugitive-slave cases. Who
that has seen mobs practically put down, and mayors
cowed into decency, by the silent dignity of those rows
of women who sat, with their knitting, more imperturbable
than the men, can read without a smile these
doubts of the “steadiness” of that sex? Again,
among Quaker women, I have asked the opinion of
prominent Friends, as of John G. Whittier, whether it
has been the experience of that body that women were
more flighty and unsteady than men in their official
action; and have been uniformly answered in the negative.
And finally, as to benevolent organizations, a
good test is given in the fact,—first pointed out, I believe,
by that eminently practical philanthropist, Rev.
Augustus Woodbury of Providence,—that the whole
tendency has been, during the last twenty years, to put
the management, even the financial control, of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>benevolent societies, more and more into the hands of
women, and that there has never been the slightest reason
to reverse this policy. Ask the secretaries of the
various boards of State Charities, or the officers of the
Social Science Associations, if they have found reason
to complain of the want of steadfast qualities in the
“weaker sex.” Why is it that the legislation of Massachusetts
has assigned the class requiring the steadiest
of all supervision—the imprisoned convicts—to “five
commissioners of prisons, two of whom shall be women”?
These are the points which it would be worthy
of our journals to consider, instead of hastily generalizing
from single instances. Let us appeal from the
typical woman of the editorial picture,—fickle, unsteady,
foolish,—to the nobler conception of womanhood
which the poet Wordsworth found fulfilled in his
own household:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>When the Massachusetts House of Representatives
had “School Suffrage” under consideration, the other
day, the suggestion was made by one of the pithiest
and quaintest of the speakers, that men were always
better for the society of women, and therefore ought
to vote in their company. “If all of us,” he said,
“would stay away from all places where we cannot
take our wives and daughters with us, we should keep
better company than we now do.” This expresses a
feeling which grows more and more common among
the better class of men, and which is the key to much
progress in the condition of women. There can be
no doubt that the increased association of the sexes in
society, in school, in literature, tends to purify these
several spheres of action. Yet, when we come to
philosophize on this, there occur some perplexities on
the way.</p>

<p class='c014'>For instance, the exclusion of woman from all these
spheres was in ancient Greece almost complete; yet
the leading Greek poets, as Homer and the tragedians,
are exceedingly chaste in tone, and in this respect beyond
most of the great poets of modern nations. Again
no European nation has quite so far sequestered and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>subordinated women as has Spain; and yet the whole
tone of Spanish literature is conspicuously grave and
decorous. This plainly indicates that race has much
to do with the matter, and that the mere admission or
exclusion of women is but one among several factors.
In short, it is easy to make out a case by a rhetorical
use of the facts on one side; but, if we look at all the
facts, the matter presents greater difficulties.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, it is to be noted that in several countries
the first women who have taken prominent part in literature
have been as bad as the men; as, for instance,
Marguerite of Navarre and Mrs. Aphra Behn. This
might indeed be explained by supposing that they had
to gain entrance into literature by accepting the dissolute
standards which they found prevailing. But it
would probably be more correct to say that these
standards themselves were variable, and that their variation
affected, at certain periods, women as well as
men. Marguerite of Navarre wrote religious books as
well as merry stories; and we know from Lockhart’s
Life of Scott, that ladies of high character in Edinburgh
used to read Mrs. Behn’s tales and plays aloud,
at one time, with delight,—although one of the same
ladies found, in her old age, that she could not read
them to herself without blushing. Shakspeare puts
coarse repartees into the mouths of women of stainless
virtue. George Sand is not considered an unexceptionable
writer; but she tells us in her autobiography
that she found among her grandmother’s papers poems
and satires so indecent that she could not read them
through, and yet they bore the names of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abbés</span></i> and
gentlemen whom she remembered in her childhood as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>models of dignity and honor. Voltaire inscribes to
ladies of high rank, who doubtless regarded it as a
great compliment, verses such as not even a poet of the
English “fleshly school” would now print at all. In
“Poems by Eminent Ladies,”—published in 1755 and
reprinted in 1774,—there are one or two poems as
gross and disgusting as any thing in Swift; yet their
authors were thought reputable women. Allan Ramsay’s
“Tea-Table Miscellany”—a collection of English
and Scottish songs—was first published in 1724;
and in his preface to the sixteenth edition the editor
attributes its great success, especially among the
ladies, to the fact that he has carefully excluded all
grossness, “that the modest voice and ear of the fair
singer might meet with no affront;” and adds, “the
chief bent of all my studies being to attain their good
graces.” There is no doubt of the great popularity
enjoyed by the book in all circles; yet it contains a
few songs which the most licentious newspaper would
not now publish. The inference is irresistible, from
this and many other similar facts, that the whole tone
of manners and decency has very greatly improved
among the European races within a century and a half.</p>

<p class='c014'>I suspect the truth to be, that, besides the visible
influence of race and religion, there has been an insensible
and almost unconscious improvement in each sex,
with respect to these matters, as time has passed on;
and that the mutual desire to please has enabled each
sex to help the other,—the sex which is naturally the
more refined taking the lead. But I should lay more
stress on this mutual influence, and less on mere feminine
superiority, than would be laid by many. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>often claimed by teachers that co-education helps not
only boys, but also girls, to develop greater propriety
of manners. When the sexes are wholly separate, or
associate on terms of entire inequality, no such good
influence occurs: the more equal the association, the
better for both parties. After all, the Divine model is
to be found in the family; and the best ingenuity cannot
improve much upon it.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE HOME.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“In respect to the powers and rights of married women,
the law is by no means abreast of the spirit of the age. Here
are seen the old fossil footprints of feudalism. The law relating
to woman tends to make every family a barony or a
monarchy or a despotism, of which the husband is the baron,
king, or despot, and the wife the dependent, serf, or slave.
That this is not always the fact, is not due to the law, but
to the enlarged humanity which spurns the narrow limits of
its rules. The progress of civilization has changed the family
from a barony to a republic; but the law has not kept pace
with the advance of ideas, manners, and customs.”—<span class='sc'>W. W.
Story</span>’s <cite>Treatise on Contracts not under Seal</cite>, § 84,—third
edition, p. 89.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>WANTED—HOMES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We see advertisements, occasionally, of “Homes for
Aged Women,” and more rarely “Homes for Aged
Men.” The question sometimes suggests itself, whether
it would not be better to begin the provision earlier,
and see that homes are also provided, in some form,
for the middle-aged and even the young. The trouble
is, I suppose, that as it takes two to make a bargain,
so it takes at least two to make a home; and unluckily
it takes only one to spoil it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame Roland once defined marriage as an institution
where one person undertakes to provide happiness
for two; and many failures are accounted for, no
doubt, by this false basis. Sometimes it is the man,
more often the woman, of whom this extravagant demand
is made. There are marriages which have proved
a wreck almost wholly through the fault of the wife.
Nor is this confined to wedded homes alone. I have
known a son who lived alone, patiently and uncomplainingly,
with that saddest of all conceivable companions,
a drunken mother. I have known another
young man who supported in his own home a mother
and sister, both habitual drunkards. All these were
American-born, and all of respectable social position.
A home shadowed by such misery is not a home, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>it might have been a home but for the sins of women.
Such instances are, however, rare and occasional compared
with the cases where the same offence in the husband
makes ruin of the home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then there are the cases where indolence, or selfishness,
or vanity, or the love of social excitement, in the
woman, unfits her for home life. Here we come upon
ground where perhaps woman is the greater sinner. It
must be remembered, however, that against this must
be balanced the neglect produced by club-life, or by
the life of society-membership, in a man. A brilliant
young married belle in London once told me that she
was glad her husband was so fond of his club, for
it amused him every night while she went to balls.
“Married men do not go much into society here,” she
said, “unless they are regular flirts,—which I do not
think my husband would ever be, for he is very fond
of me,—so he goes every night to his club, and gets
home about the same time that I do. It is a very nice
arrangement.” It was apparently spoken in all the
fearlessness of innocence, but I believe that it has since
ended in a “separation.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is common to denounce club-life in our large cities
as destructive of the home. The modern club is simply
a more refined substitute for the old-fashioned
tavern, and is on the whole an advance in morals as
well as manners. In our large cities a man in a certain
social coterie belongs to a club, if he can afford it,
as a means of contact with his fellows, and to have
various conveniences which he cannot so economically
obtain at home. A few haunt them constantly: the
many use them occasionally. More absorbing than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>clubs, perhaps, are the secret societies which have so
revived among us since the war, and which consume
time so fearfully. There was a case mentioned in the
newspapers lately of a man who belonged to some
twenty of these associations; and when he died, and
each wished to conduct his funeral, great was the
strife! In the small city where I write, there are seventeen
secret societies down in the directory, and I suppose
as many more not so conspicuous. I meet men
who assure me that they habitually attend a societymeeting
every evening of the week except Sunday, and
a church meeting then. These are rarely men of leisure:
they are usually mechanics or business men of some
kind, who are hard at work all day, and never see their
families except at meal-times. Their case is far worse,
so far as absence from home is concerned, than that of
the “club-men” of large cities; for these are often
men of leisure, who, if married, at least make home
one of their lounging-places, which the secret-society
men do not.</p>

<p class='c014'>I honestly believe that this melancholy desertion of
the home is largely due to the traditional separation
between the alleged spheres of the sexes. The theory
still prevails largely, that home is the peculiar province
of the woman, that she has almost no duties out of it;
and hence, naturally enough, that the husband has almost
no duties in it. If he is amused there, let him
stay there; but, as it is not his recognized sphere of
duty, he is not actually violating any duty by absenting
himself. This theory even pervades our manuals of
morals, of metaphysics, and of popular science; and
it is not every public teacher who has the manliness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>having once stated it, to modify his statement, as did
the venerable President Hopkins of Williams College,
when lecturing the other day to the young ladies of
Vassar.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would,” he said, “at this point correct my teaching
in ‘The Law of Love’ to the effect that home is
peculiarly the sphere of woman, and civil government
that of man. <em>I now regard the home as the joint sphere
of man and woman, and the sphere of civil government
more of an open question as between the two.</em> It is,
however, to be lamented that the present agitation concerning
the rights of woman is so much a matter of
‘rights’ rather than of ‘duties,’ as the reform of the
latter would involve the former.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If our instructors in moral philosophy will only base
their theory of ethics as broadly as this, we shall no
longer need to advertise “Homes Wanted;” for the
joint efforts of men and women will soon provide them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Nothing throws more light on the whole history of
woman than the first illustration in Sir John Lubbock’s
“Origin of Civilization.” A young girl, almost naked,
is being dragged furiously along the ground by a party
of naked savages, armed literally to the teeth, while
those of another band grasp her by the arm, and almost
tear her asunder in the effort to hold her back. These
last are her brothers and her friends; the others are—her
enemies? As you please to call them. They are
her future husband and his kinsmen, who have come
to aid him in his wooing.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was the primitive rite of marriage. Vestiges
of it still remain among savage nations. And all the
romance and grace of the most refined modern marriage—the
orange-blossoms, the bridal veil, the church
service, the wedding-feast—these are only the “bright
consummate flower” reared by civilization from that
rough seed. All the brutal encounter is softened into
this. Nothing remains of the barbarism except the
one word “obey,” and even that is going.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, to say that a thing is going, is to say that it
will presently be gone. To say that any thing is
changed, is to say that it is to change further. If it
never has been altered, perhaps it will not be; but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>proved alteration of an inch in a year opens the way
to an indefinite modification. The study of the glaciers,
for instance, began with the discovery that they
had moved; and from that moment no one doubted that
they were moving all the time. It is the same with the
position of woman. Once open your eyes to the fact
that it has changed, and who is to predict where the
matter shall end? It is sheer folly to say, “Her relative
position will always be what it has been,” when
one glance at Sir John Lubbock’s picture shows that
there is no fixed “has been,” but that her original
position was long since altered and revised. Those
who still use this argument are like those who laughed
at the lines of stakes which Agassiz planted across the
Aar glacier in 1840. But the stakes settled the question,
and proved the motion. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pero si muove</span></i>: “But it
moves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The motion once proved, the whole range of possible
progress is before us. The amazement of that formerly
“heathen Chinee” in Boston, the other day, when he
saw a woman addressing a missionary meeting; the
astonishment of all English visitors when young ladies
hear classes in geometry and Latin, in our high schools;
the surprise of foreigners at seeing the rough throng in
the Cooper Institute reading-room submit to the sway
of one young woman with a crochet-needle—all these
simply testify to the fact that the stakes have moved.
That they have yet been carried half way to the end,
who knows? What a step from the horrible nuptials of
those savage days to the poetic marriage of Robert
Browning and Elizabeth Barrett—the “Sonnets from
the Portuguese” on one side, the “One Word More”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>on the other! But who can say that the whole relation
between man and woman reached its climax there, and
that where the past has brought changes so vast the
future is to add nothing? Who knows that, when
“the world’s great bridals come,” people may not look
back with pity, even on this era of the Brownings?
Probably even Elizabeth Barrett promised to obey!</p>

<p class='c014'>At any rate, it is safe to say that each step concedes
the probability of another. Even from the naked barbarian
to the veiled Oriental, from the savage hut to
the carefully enshrined harem, is a step forward. It
is another step in the spiral line of progress to the
unveiled face and comparatively free movements of the
modern English or American woman. From the kitchen
to the public lecture-room, from that to the lecture-platform,
and from that again to the ballot-box,—these
are far slighter steps than those which have
already lifted the savage girl of Sir John Lubbock’s
picture into the possession of the alphabet and the
dignity of a home. So easy are these future changes
beside those of the past, that to doubt their possibility
is as if Agassiz, after tracing year by year the motion
of his Alpine glacier, should deny its power to move
one inch farther into the sunny valley, and there to
melt harmlessly away.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOW-WATER MARK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We constantly see it assumed, in arguments against
any step in the elevation of woman, that her position
is a thing fixed permanently by nature, so that there
can be in it no great or essential change. Every successive
modification is resisted as “a reform against
nature;” and this argument from permanence is always
that appealing most strongly to conservative minds.
Let us see how the facts confirm it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A story is going the rounds of the newspapers in
regard to a Russian peasant and his wife. For some
act of disobedience the peasant took the law into his
own hands; and his mode of discipline was to tie the
poor creature naked to a post in the street, and to call
on every passer-by to strike her a blow. Not satisfied
with this, he placed her on the ground, and tied heavy
weights on her limbs until one arm was broken. When
finally released, she made a complaint against him in
court. The court discharged him on the ground that
he had not exceeded the legal authority of a husband.
Encouraged by this, he caused her to be arrested in
return; and the same court sentenced her to another
public whipping for disobedience.</p>

<p class='c014'>No authority was given for this story in the newspaper
where I saw it; but it certainly did not first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>appear in a woman-suffrage newspaper, and cannot
therefore be a manufactured “outrage.” I use it
simply to illustrate the low-water mark at which the
position of woman may rest, in the largest Christian
nation of the world. All the refinements, all the education,
all the comparative justice, of modern society,
have been gradually upheaved from some such depth
as this. When the gypsies described by Leland treat
even the ground trodden upon by a woman as impure,
they simply illustrate the low plane from which all the
elevation of woman has begun. All these things show
that the position of that sex in society, so far from
being a thing in itself permanent, has been in reality the
most variable of all factors in the social problem. And
this inevitably suggests the question, Are we any more
sure that her present position is finally and absolutely
fixed than were those who observed it at any previous
time in the world’s history? Granting that her condition
was once at low-water mark, who is authorized to
say that it has yet reached high-tide?</p>

<p class='c014'>It is very possible that this Russian wife, once
scourged back to submission, ended her days in the
conviction, and taught to her daughters, that such was
a woman’s rightful place. When an American woman
of to-day says, “I have all the rights I want,” is she
on any surer ground? Grant that the difference is vast
between the two. How do we know that even the later
condition is final, or that any thing is final but entire
equality before the laws? It is not many years since
William Story—in a legal work inspired and revised by
his father, the greatest of American jurists—wrote this
indignant protest against the injustice of the old common
law:—</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“In respect to the powers and rights of married women,
the law is by no means abreast of the spirit of the age. Here

advance of ideas, manners, and customs. And, although public
opinion is a check to legal rules on the subject, the rules are
feudal and stern. Yet the position of woman throughout history
serves as the criterion of the freedom of the people or an
age. When man shall despise that right which is founded
only on might, woman will be free and stand on an equal level
with him,—a friend and not a dependent.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>We know that the law is greatly changed and ameliorated

but we also know how almost every one of these
changes was resisted: and who is authorized to say
that the final and equitable fulfilment is yet reached?</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>“OBEY.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After witnessing the marriage ceremony of the Episcopal
Church, the other day, I walked down the aisle
with the young rector who had officiated. It was natural
to speak of the beauty of the Church service on
an occasion like that; but, after doing this, I felt
compelled to protest against the unrighteous pledge to
obey. “I hope,” I said, “to live to see that word
expunged from the Episcopal service, as it has been
from that of the Methodists.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?” he asked. “Is it because you know that
they will not obey, whatever their promise?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because they ought not,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said he, after a few moments’ reflection,
and looking up frankly, “I do not think they ought!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here was a young clergyman of great earnestness
and self-devotion, who included it among the sacred
duties of his life to impose upon ignorant young girls
a solemn obligation, which he yet thought they ought
not to incur, and did not believe that they would keep.
There could hardly be a better illustration of the confusion
in the public mind, or the manner in which “the
subjection of woman” is being outgrown, or the subtile
way in which this subjection has been interwoven
with sacred ties, and baptized “duty.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The advocates of woman suffrage are constantly
reproved for using the terms “subjection,” “oppression,”
and “slavery,” as applied to woman. They
simply commit the same sin as that committed by the
original abolitionists. They are “as harsh as truth,
as uncompromising as justice.” Of course they talk
about oppression and emancipation. It is the word
<em>obey</em> that constitutes the one, and shows the need of
the other. Whoever is pledged to obey is technically
and literally a slave, no matter how many roses surround
the chains. All the more so if the slavery is
self-imposed, and surrounded by all the prescriptions
of religion. Make the marriage-tie as close as Church
or State can make it; but let it be equal, impartial.
That it may be so, the word <em>obey</em> must be abandoned
or made reciprocal. Where invariable obedience is
promised, equality is gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>That there may be no doubt about the meaning of
this word in the marriage-covenant, the usages of nations
often add symbolic explanations. These are generally
simple and brutal enough to be understood. The
Hebrew ceremony, when the bridegroom took off his
slipper and struck the bride on the neck as she crossed
his threshold, was unmistakable. As my black sergeant
said, when a white prisoner questioned his authority,
and he pointed to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevrons</span></i> on his sleeve,
“Dat mean guv’ment.” All these forms mean simply
government also. The ceremony of the slipper has
now no recognition, except when people fling an old
shoe after the bride, which is held by antiquarians to
be the same observance. But it is all preserved and
concentrated into a single word, when the bride promises
to obey.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The deepest wretchedness that has ever been put
into human language, or that has exceeded it, has grown
out of that pledge. There is no misery on earth like
that of a pure and refined woman who finds herself
owned, body and soul, by a drunken, licentious, brutal
man. The very fact that she is held to obedience by
a spiritual tie makes it worse. Chattel-slavery was not
so bad; for, though the master might pervert religion
for his own satisfaction, he could not impose upon the
slave. Never yet did I see a negro slave who thought
it a duty to obey his master; and therefore there was
always some dream of release. But who has not
heard of some delicate and refined woman, one day of
whose torture was equivalent to years of that possible
to an obtuser frame,—who had the door of escape
ready at hand for years, and yet died a lingering death
rather than pass through it; and this because she had
promised to obey!</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said of one of the most gifted women who ever
trod American soil,—she being of English birth,—that,
before she obtained the divorce which separated
her from her profligate husband, she once went for counsel
to the wife of her pastor. She unrolled before her
the long catalogue of merciless outrages to which she had
been subject, endangering finally her health, her life,
and that of her children born and to be born. When
she turned at last for advice to her confessor, with the
agonized inquiry, “What is it my duty to do?”—“Do?”
said the stern adviser: “Lie down on the
floor, and let your husband trample on you if he will.
That is a woman’s duty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The woman who gave this advice was not naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>inhuman nor heartless: she had simply been trained in
the school of obedience. The Jesuit doctrine, that a
priest should be as a corpse, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">perinde ac cadaver</span></i>, in the
hands of a superior priest, is not worse. Woman has
no right to delegate, nor man to assume, a responsibility
so awful. Just in proportion as it is consistently
carried out, it trains men from boyhood into self-indulgent
tyrants; and, while some women are transformed
by it to saints, others are crushed into deceitful slaves.
That this was the result of chattel-slavery, this nation
has at length learned. We learn more slowly the profounder
and more subtile moral evil that follows from
the unrighteous promise to obey.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>WOMAN IN THE CHRYSALIS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When the bride receives the ring upon her finger,
and utters—if she utters it—the unnatural promise
to obey, she fancies a poetic beauty in the rite. Turning
of her own free will from her maiden liberty, she
voluntarily takes the yoke of service upon her. This
is her view; but is this the historic fact in regard to
marriage? Not at all. The pledge of obedience—the
whole theory of inequality in marriage—is simply
what is left to us of a former state of society, in which
every woman, old or young, must obey somebody.
The state of tutelage, implied in such a marriage, is
merely what is left of the old theory of the “Perpetual
Tutelage of Women,” under the Roman law.</p>

<p class='c014'>Roman law, from which our civil law is derived,
has its foundation evidently in patriarchal tradition.
It recognized at first the family only, and that family
was held together by parental power (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</span></i>).
If the father died, his powers passed to the son
or grandson, as the possible head of a new family;
but these powers never could pass to a woman, and
every woman, of whatever age, must be under somebody’s
legal control. Her father dying, she was still
subject through life to her nearest male relations, or
to her father’s nominees, as her guardians. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>under perpetual guardianship, both as to person or
property. No years, no experience, could make her
any thing but a child before the law.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Oriental countries the system was still more complete.
“A man,” says the Gentoo Code of Laws,
“must keep his wife so much in subjection that she by
no means be mistress of her own action. If the wife
have her own free will, notwithstanding she be of a
superior caste, she will behave amiss.” But this authority,
which still exists in India, is not merely conjugal.
The husband exerts it simply as being the
wife’s legal guardian. If the woman be unmarried or
a widow, she must be as rigorously held under some
other guardianship. It is no uncommon thing for a
woman in India to be the ward of her own son. Lucretia
Mott or Florence Nightingale would there be in
personal subjection to somebody. Any man of legal
age would be recognized as a fit custodian for them,
but there must be a man.</p>

<p class='c014'>With some variation of details at different periods,
the same system prevailed essentially at Rome, down
to the time when Rome became Christian. Those who
wish for particulars will find them in an admirable
chapter (the fifth) of Maine’s “Ancient Law.” At
one time the husband was held to possess the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria
potestas</span></i>, or parental power, in its full force. By law
“the woman passed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in manum viri</span></i>, that is, she became
the daughter of her husband.” All she had became
his, and after his death she was retained in the same
strict tutelage by any guardians his will might appoint.
Afterwards, to soften this rigid bond, the woman was
regarded in law as being temporarily deposited by her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>family with her husband; the family appointed guardians
over her: and thus, between the two tyrannies,
she won a sort of independence. Then came Christianity,
and swept away the parental authority for
married women, concentrating all upon the husband.
Hence our legislation bears the mark of a double origin,
and woman is half recognized as an equal and half as
a slave.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is necessary to remember, therefore, that all the
relation of subjection in marriage is merely the residue
of an unnatural system, of which all else is long
since outgrown. It would have seemed to an ancient
Roman a matter of course that a woman should, all
her life long, obey the guardians set over her person.
It still seems to many people a matter of course that
she should obey her husband. To others among us, on
the contrary, both these theories of obedience seem barbarous,
and the one is merely a relic of the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>We cannot disregard the history of the Theory of
Tutelage. If we could believe that a chrysalis is
always a chrysalis, and a butterfly always a butterfly,
we could easily leave each to its appropriate sphere;
but when we see the chrysalis open, and the butterfly
come half out of it, we know that sooner or later it
must spread wings, and fly. The theory of tutelage is
the chrysalis. Woman is the butterfly. Sooner or
later she will be wholly out.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>TWO AND TWO.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A young man of very good brains was telling me,
the other day, his dreams of his future wife. Rattling
on, more in joke than in earnest, he said, “She must
be perfectly ignorant, and a bigot: she must know
nothing, and believe every thing. I should wish to have
her call to me from the adjoining room, ‘My dear,
what do two and two make?’”</p>

<p class='c014'>It did not seem to me that his demand would be so
very hard to fill, since bigotry and ignorance are to be
had almost anywhere for the asking; and, as for two
and two, I should say that it had always been the habit
of women to ask that question of some man, and to rest
easily satisfied with the answer. They have generally
called, as my friend wished, from some other room, saying,
“My dear, what do two and two make?” and the
husband or father or brother has answered and said,
“My dear, they make four for a man, and three for a
woman.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At any given period in the history of woman, she
has adopted man’s whim as the measure of her rights;
has claimed nothing; has sweetly accepted any thing:
the law of two-and-two itself should be at his discretion.
At any given moment, so well was his interpretation
received, that it stood for absolute right. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Rome a woman, married or single, could not testify in
court; in the middle ages, and down to quite modern
times, she could not hold real estate; ten years ago
she could not, in New England, obtain a collegiate
education; even now she cannot vote.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first principles of republican government are so
rehearsed and re-rehearsed, that one would think they
must become “as plain as that two and two make
four.” But we find throughout, that, as Emerson said
of another class of reasoners, “Their two is not the
real two; their four is not the real four.” We find
different numerals and diverse arithmetical rules for
the two sexes; as, in some Oriental countries, men and
women speak different dialects of the same language.</p>

<p class='c014'>In novels the hero often begins by dreaming, like
my friend, of an ideal wife, who shall be ignorant of
every thing, and have only brains enough to be bigoted.
Instead of sighing, like Falstaff, “Oh for a fine
young thief, of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts!”
the hero sighs for a fine young idiot of similar
age. When the hero is successful in his search and
wooing, the novelist sometimes mercifully removes the
young woman early, like David Copperfield’s Dora, she
bequeathing the bereaved husband, on her death-bed,
to a woman of sense. In real life these convenient
interruptions do not commonly occur, and the foolish
youth regrets through many years that he did not select
an Agnes instead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The acute observer Stendhal says,—</p>

<p class='c021'>“In Paris, the highest praise for a marriageable girl is to
say, ‘She has great sweetness of character and the disposition
of a lamb.’ Nothing produces more impression on fools who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>are looking out for wives. I think I see the interesting couple,
two years after, breakfasting together on a dull day, with three
tall lackeys waiting upon them!”</p>

<p class='c014'>And he adds, still speaking in the interest of men,—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Most men have a period in their career when they might
do something great, a period when nothing seems impossible.
The ignorance of women spoils for the human race this magnificent
opportunity; and love, at the utmost, in these days,
only inspires a young man to learn to ride well, or to make a
judicious selection of a tailor.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Society, however, discovers by degrees that there are
conveniences in every woman’s knowing the four rules
of arithmetic for herself. Two and two come to the
same amount on a butcher’s bill, whether the order be
given by a man or a woman; and it is the same in
all affairs or investments, financial or moral. We shall
one day learn that with laws, customs, and public
affairs it is even so. Once get it rooted in a woman’s
mind, that, for her, two and two make three only, and
sooner or later the accounts of the whole human race
fail to balance.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>A MODEL HOUSEHOLD.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is an African bird called the hornbill, whose
habits are in some respects a model. The female builds
her nest in a hollow tree, lays her eggs, and broods
on them. So far, so good. Then the male feels that
he must also contribute some service; so he walls up
the hole closely, giving only room for the point of the
female’s bill to protrude. Until the eggs are hatched,
she is thenceforth confined to her nest, and is in the
mean time fed assiduously by her mate, who devotes
himself entirely to this object. Dr. Livingstone has
seen these nests in Africa, Layard and others in Asia,
and Wallace in Sumatra.</p>

<p class='c014'>Personally I have never seen a hornbill’s nest. The
nearest approach I ever made to it was when in Fayal
I used to pass near a gloomy mansion, of which the
front windows were walled up, and only one high window
was visible in the rear, beyond the reach of eyes
from any neighboring house. In this cheerful abode,
I was assured, a Portuguese lady had been for many
years confined by her jealous husband. It was long
since any neighbor had caught a glimpse of her, but it
was supposed that she was alive. There is no reason
to doubt that her husband fed her well. It was simply
a case of human hornbill, with the imprisonment made
perpetual.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>I have more than once asked lawyers whether, in
communities where the old common law prevailed, there
was any thing to prevent such an imprisonment of a
married woman; and they have always answered,
“Nothing but public opinion.” Where the husband
has the legal custody of the wife’s person, no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas
corpus</span></i> can avail against him. The hornbill household
is based on a strict application of the old common law.
A Hindoo household was a hornbill household: “a
woman, of whatsoever age, should never be mistress of
her own actions,” said the code of Menu. An Athenian
household was a hornbill’s nest, and great was the
outcry when some Aspasia broke out of it. When Mrs.
Sherman petitions Congress against the emancipation
of woman, we seem to hear the twittering of the hornbill
mother, imploring to be left inside.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under some forms, the hornbill theory becomes respectable.
There are many peaceful families, innocent
though torpid, where the only dream of existence is to
have plenty of quiet, plenty of food, and plenty of
well-fed children. For them this African household is
a sufficient model. The wife is “a home body.” The
husband is “a good provider.” These are honest people,
and have a right to speak. The hornbill theory is
only dishonest when it comes—as it often comes—from
women who lead the life, not of good stay-at-home
fowls, but of paroquets and humming-birds,—who
sorrowfully bemoan the active habits of enlightened
women, while they themselves</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bear about the mockery of woe</div>
      <div class='line'>To midnight dances and the public show.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>It is from these women, in Washington, New York,
and elsewhere, that the loudest appeal for the hornbill
standard of domesticity proceeds. Put them to the
test, and give them their chicken-salad and champagne
through a hole in the wall only, and see how they like it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But even the most honest and peaceful conservatives
will one day admit that the hornbill is not the highest
model. Plato thought that “the soul of our grandame
might haply inhabit the body of a bird;” but Nature
has kindly provided various types of bird-households
to suit all varieties of taste. The bright orioles, filling
the summer boughs with color and with song, are as
truly domestic in the freedom of their airy nest as the
poor hornbills who ignorantly make home into a dungeon.
And certainly each new generation of orioles,
spreading their free wings from that pendent cradle,
are a happier illustration of judicious nurture than are
the uncouth little offspring of the hornbills, whom
Wallace describes as “so flabby and semi-transparent
as to resemble a bladder of jelly, furnished with head,
legs, and rudimentary wings, but with not a sign of a
feather, except a few lines of points indicating where
they would come.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXX.<br /> <span class='large'>A SAFEGUARD FOR THE FAMILY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Many German-Americans are warm friends of woman
suffrage; but the editors of “Puck,” it seems, are
not. In a late number of that comic journal, it had an
unfavorable cartoon on this reform; and in a following
number,—the number, by the way, which contains that
amusing illustration of the vast seaside hotels of the
future, with the cheering announcement, “Only one
mile to the barber’s shop,” and “Take the cars to the
dining-room,”—a lady comes to the rescue, and bravely
defends woman suffrage. It seems that the original
cartoon depicted in the corner a pretty family scene,
representing father, mother, and children seated happily
together, with the melancholy motto, “Nevermore,
nevermore!” And when the correspondent, Mrs.
Blake, very naturally asks what this touching picture
has to do with woman suffrage, Puck says, “If the
husband in our ‘pretty family scene’ should propose to
vote for the candidate who was obnoxious to his wife,
would this ‘pretty family scene’ continue to be a domestic
paradise, or would it remind the spectator of the
region in which Dante spent his ‘fortnight off’?”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is beautiful to see how much anxiety there is to
preserve the family. Every step in the modification of
the old common law, whereby the wife was, in Baron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Alderson’s phrase, “the servant of her husband,” was
resisted as tending to endanger the family. That the
wife should control her own earnings, so that her husband
should not have the right to collect them in order
to pay his gambling-debts, was declared by English
advocates, in the celebrated case of the Hon. Mrs.
Norton, the poetess, to imperil all the future peace of
British households. Even the liberal-minded “Punch,”
about the time Girton College was founded in England,
expressed grave doubts whether the harmony of wedded
unions would not receive a blow, from the time when
wives should be liable to know more Greek than their
husbands. Yet the marriage relation has withstood
these innovations. It has not been impaired, either
by separate rights, private earnings, or independent
Greek: can it be possible that a little voting will overthrow
it?</p>

<p class='c014'>The very ground on which woman suffrage is opposed
by its enemies might assuage these fears. If, as we
are told, women will not take the pains to vote except
upon the strongest inducements, who has so good an
opportunity as the husband to bring those inducements
to bear? and, if so, what is the separation? Or if, as
we are told, women will merely reflect their husbands’
political opinions, why should they dispute about them?
The mere suggestion of a difference deep enough to
quarrel for, implies a real difference of convictions or
interests, and indicates that there ought to be an independent
representation of each; unless we fall back,
once for all, on the common-law tradition that man and
wife are one, and that one is the husband. Either the
antagonisms which occur in politics are comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>superficial, in which case they would do no harm; or
else they touch matters of real interest and principle,
in which case every human being has a right to independent
expression, even at a good deal of risk. In
either case, the objection falls to the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have fortunately a means of testing, with some
fairness of estimate, the probable amount of this peril.
It is generally admitted,—and certainly no German-American
will deny,—that the most fruitful sources of
hostility and war in all times have been religious, not
political. All merely political antagonism, certainly
all which is possible in a republic, fades into insignificance
before this more powerful dividing influence. Yet
we leave all this great explosive force in unimpeded
operation,—at any moment it may be set in action,
in any one of those “pretty family scenes” which
“Puck” depicts,—while we are solemnly warned
against admitting the comparatively mild peril of a
political difference! It is like cautioning a manufacturer
of dynamite against the danger of meddling with
mere edge-tools. Even with all the intensity of feeling
on religious matters, few families are seriously divided
by them; and the influence of political differences would
be still more insignificant.</p>

<p class='c014'>The simple fact is, that there is no better basis for
union than mutual respect for each other’s opinions;
and this can never be obtained without an intelligent
independence. “I would rather have a thorn in my
side than an echo,” said Emerson of friendship; and
the same is true of married life. It is the echoes, the
nonentities, of whom men grow tired; it is the women
with some flavor of individuality who keep the hearts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of their husbands. This is only applying in a higher
sense what Shakspeare’s Cleopatra saw. When her
handmaidens are questioning how to hold a lover, and
one says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Give way to him in all: cross him in nothing,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Cleopatra, from the depth of an unequalled experience,
retorts,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou speakest like a fool: the way to lose him!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And what “the serpent of old Nile” said, the wives of
the future, who are to be wise as serpents and harmless
as doves, may well ponder. It takes two things different
to make a union; and part of that difference may
as well lie in matters political as anywhere else.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>WOMEN AS ECONOMISTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>An able lawyer of Boston, arguing the other day
before a legislative committee in favor of giving to the
city council a check upon the expenditures of the school
committee, gave as one reason that this body would
probably include more women henceforward, and that
women were ordinarily more lavish than men in their
use of money. The truth of this assumption was questioned
at the time: and, the more I think of it, the more
contrary it is to my whole experience. I should say that
women, from the very habit of their lives, are led to be
more particular about details, and more careful as to
small economies. The very fact that they handle less
money tends to this. When they are told to spend
money, as they often are by loving or ambitious husbands,
they no doubt do it freely: they have naturally
more taste than men, and quite as much love of luxury.
In some instances in this country they spend money
recklessly and wickedly, like the heroines of French
novels; but as, even in brilliant Paris, the women of
the middle classes are notoriously better managers than
the men, so we often see, in our scheming America, the
same relative superiority. Often have I heard young
men say, “I never knew how to economize until after
my marriage;” and who has not seen multitudes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>instances where women accustomed to luxury have accepted
poverty without a murmur for the sake of those
whom they loved?</p>

<p class='c014'>I remember a young girl, accustomed to the gayest
society of New York, who engaged herself to a young
naval officer, against the advice of the friends of both.
One of her near relatives said to me, “Of all the
young girls I have ever known, she is the least fitted
for a poor man’s wife.” Yet from the very moment of
her marriage she brought their joint expenses within
his scanty pay, and even saved a little money from it.
Everybody knows such instances. We hear men denounce
the extravagance of women, while those very
men spend on wine and cigars, on clubs and horses,
twice what their wives spend on their toilet. If the
wives are economical, the husbands perhaps urge them
on to greater lavishness. “Why do you not dress
like Mrs. So-and-so?”—“I can’t afford it.”—“But
<em>I</em> can afford it;” and then, when the bills come in,
the talk of extravagance recommences. At one time
in Newport that lady among the summer visitors who
was reported to be Worth’s best customer was also well
known to be quite indifferent to society, and to go into
it mainly to please her husband, whose social ambition
was notorious.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has often happened to me to serve in organizations
where both sexes were represented, and where expenditures
were to be made for business or pleasure. In
these I have found, as a rule, that the women were
more careful, or perhaps I should say more timid, than
the men, less willing to risk any thing: the bolder
financial experiments came from the men, as one might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>expect. In talking the other day with the secretary
of an important educational enterprise, conducted by
women, I was surprised to find that it was cramped for
money, though large subscriptions were said to have
been made to it. On inquiry it appeared that these
ladies, having pledged themselves for four years, had
divided the amount received into four parts, and were
resolutely limiting themselves, for the first year, to one
quarter part of what had been subscribed. No board
of men would have done so. Any board of men would
have allowed far more than a quarter of the sum for
the first year’s expenditures, justly reasoning that if
the enterprise began well it would command public
confidence, and bring in additional subscriptions as
time went on. I would appeal to any one whose
experience has been in joint associations of men and
women, whether this is not a fair statement of the
difference between their ways of working. It does not
prove that women are more honest than men, but that
their education or their nature makes them more cautious
in expenditure.</p>

<p class='c014'>The habits of society make the dress of a fashionable
woman far more expensive than that of a man of fashion.
Formerly it was not so; and, so long as it was
not so, the extravagance of men in this respect quite
equalled that of women. It now takes other forms,
but the habit is the same. There is not a club-house
in Boston furnished with such absence of luxury as the
Women’s Club rooms on Park Street: the contrast was
at first so great as to seem almost absurd. The waiters
at any fashionable restaurant will tell you that what is
a cheap dinner for a man would be a dear dinner for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>woman. Yet after all, the test is not in any particular
class of expenditures, but in the business-like habit.
Men are of course more business-like in large combinations,
for they are more used to them; but for the
small details of daily economy women are more watchful.
The cases where women ruin their husbands by
extravagance are exceptional. As a rule, the men are
the bread-winners; but the careful saving and managing
and contriving come from the women.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>GREATER INCLUDES LESS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I was once at a little musical party in New York,
where several accomplished amateur singers were present,
and with them the eminent professional, Miss
Adelaide Phillips. The amateurs were first called on.
Each chose some difficult operatic passage, and sang her
best. When it came to the great opera-singer’s turn,
instead of exhibiting her ability to eclipse those rivals on
her own ground, she simply seated herself at the piano,
and sang “Kathleen Mavourneen” with such thrilling
sweetness, that the young Irish girl who was setting
the supper-table in the next room forgot all her plates
and teaspoons, threw herself into a chair, put her apron
over her face, and sobbed as if her heart would break.
All the training of Adelaide Phillips—her magnificent
voice, her stage experience, her skill in effects,
her power of expression—went into the performance
of that simple song. The greater included the less.
And thus all the intellectual and practical training
that any woman can have, all her public action and her
active career, will make her, if she be a true woman,
more admirable as a wife, a mother, and a friend. The
greater includes the less for her also.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course this is a statement of general facts and
tendencies. There must be among women, as among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>men, an endless variety of individual temperaments.
There will always be plenty whose career will illustrate
the infirmities of genius, and whom no training can
convince that two and two make four. But the general
fact is sure. As no sensible man would seriously prefer
for a wife a Hindoo or Tahitian woman rather than one
bred in England or America, so every further advantage
of education or opportunity will only improve, not
impair, the true womanly type.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lucy Stone once said, “Woman’s nature was stamped
and sealed by the Almighty, and there is no danger
of her unsexing herself while his eye watches her.”
Margaret Fuller said, “One hour of love will teach a
woman more of her true relations than all your philosophizing.”
These were the testimony of women who
had studied Greek, and were only the more womanly
for the study. They are worth the opinions of a million
half-developed beings like the Duchess de Fontanges,
who was described as being “as beautiful as an angel
and as silly as a goose.” The greater includes the less.
Your view from the mountain-side may be very pretty,
but she who has taken one step higher commands your
view and her own also. It was no dreamy recluse, but
the accomplished and experienced Stendhal, who wrote,
“The joys of the gay world do not count for much
with happy women.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>If a highly educated man is incapable and unpractical,
we do not say that he is educated too well, but not well
enough. He ought to know what he knows, and other
things also. Never yet did I see a woman too well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>educated to be a wife and a mother; but I know multitudes
who deplore, or have reason to deplore, every
day of their lives, the untrained and unfurnished minds
that are so ill-prepared for these sacred duties. Every
step towards equalizing the opportunities of men and
women meets with resistance, of course; but every
step, as it is accomplished, leaves men still men, and
women still women. And as we who heard Adelaide
Phillips felt that she had never had a better tribute to
her musical genius than that young Irish girl’s tears;
so the true woman will feel that all her college training
for instance, if she has it, may have been well invested,
even for the sake of the baby on her knee.
And it is to be remembered, after all, that each human
being lives to unfold his or her own powers, and do his
or her own duties first, and that neither woman nor man
has the right to accept a merely secondary and subordinate
life. A noble woman must be a noble human
being; and the most sacred special duties, as of wife
or mother, are all included in this, as the greater includes
the less.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A CO-PARTNERSHIP.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Marriage, considered merely in its financial and
business relations, may be regarded as a permanent
co-partnership.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, in an ordinary co-partnership, there is very
often a complete division of labor among the partners.
If they manufacture locomotive-engines, for instance,
one partner perhaps superintends the works, another
attends to mechanical inventions and improvements,
another travels for orders, another conducts the correspondence,
another receives and pays out the money.
The latter is not necessarily the head of the firm.
Perhaps his place could be more easily filled than some
of the other posts. Nevertheless, more money passes
through his hands than through those of all the others
put together. Now, should he, at the year’s end, call
together the inventor and the superintendent and the
traveller and the correspondent, and say to them, “I
have earned all this money this year, but I will generously
give you some of it,”—he would be considered
simply impertinent, and would hardly have a chance to
repeat the offence, the year after.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet precisely what would be called folly in this business
partnership is constantly done by men in the co-partnership
of marriage, and is there called “common-sense”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and “social science” and “political economy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For instance, a farmer works himself half to death
in the hay-field, and his wife meanwhile is working
herself wholly to death in the dairy. The neighbors
come in to sympathize after her demise; and, during
the few months’ interval before his second marriage,
they say approvingly, “He was always a generous
man to his folks! He was a good provider!” But
where was the room for generosity, any more than the
member of any other firm is to be called generous,
when he keeps the books, receipts the bills, and divides
the money?</p>

<p class='c014'>In case of the farming business, the share of the
wife is so direct and unmistakable that it can hardly be
evaded. If any thing is earned by the farm, she does
her distinct and important share of the earning. But
it is not necessary that she should do even that, to
make her, by all the rules of justice, an equal partner,
entitled to her full share of the financial proceeds.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose an ordinary case. Two young
people are married, and begin life together. Let us
suppose them equally poor, equally capable, equally
conscientious, equally healthy. They have children.
Those children must be supported by the earning of
money abroad, by attendance and care at home. If it
requires patience and labor to do the outside work, no
less is required inside. The duties of the household
are as hard as the duties of the shop or office. If the
wife took her husband’s work for a day, she would
probably be glad to return to her own. So would the
husband if he undertook hers. Their duties are ordinarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>as distinct and as equal as those of two partners
in any other co-partnership. It so happens, that the
out-door partner has the handling of the money; but
does that give him a right to claim it as his exclusive
earnings? No more than in any other business operation.</p>

<p class='c014'>He earned the money for the children and the household.
She disbursed it for the children and the household.
The very laws of nature, by giving her the
children to bear and rear, absolve her from the duty
of their support, so long as he is alive who was left
free by nature for that purpose. Her task on the
average is as hard as his: nay, a portion of it is so
especially hard that it is distinguished from all others
by the name “labor.” If it does not earn money,
it is because it is not to be measured in money, while
it exists—nor to be replaced by money, if lost. If a
business man loses his partner, he can obtain another:
and a man, no doubt, may take a second wife; but he
cannot procure for his children a second mother. Indeed,
it is a palpable insult to the whole relation of
husband and wife when one compares it, even in a
financial light, to that of business partners. It is only
because a constant effort is made to degrade the practical
position of woman below even this standard of
comparison, that it becomes her duty to claim for herself
at least as much as this.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a tradition in a town where I once lived,
that a certain Quaker, who had married a fortune, was
once heard to repel his wife, who had asked him for
money in a public place, with the response, “Rachel,
where is that ninepence I gave thee yesterday?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>When I read in Scribner’s Monthly an article deriding
the right to representation of the Massachusetts
women who pay two millions of tax on one hundred
and thirty-two million dollars of property,—asserting
that they produced nothing of it; that it was only
“men who produced this wealth, and bestowed it upon
these women;” that it was “all drawn from land
and sea by the hands of men whose largess testifies
alike of their love and their munificence,”—I must
say that I am reminded of Rachel’s ninepence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>“ONE RESPONSIBLE HEAD.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When we look through any business directory, there
seem to be almost as many co-partnerships as single
dealers; and three-quarters of these co-partnerships
appear to consist of precisely two persons, no more, no
less. These partners are, in the eye of the law, equal.
It is not found necessary under the law, to make a
general provision that in each case one partner should
be supreme and the other subordinate. In many cases,
by the terms of the co-partnership there are limitations
on one side and special privileges on the other,—marriage
settlements, as it were; but the general law of
co-partnership is based on the presumption of equality.
It would be considered infinitely absurd to require, that,
as the general rule, one party or the other should be in
a state of <em>coverture</em>, during which the very being and
existence of the one should be suspended, or entirely
merged and incorporated into that of the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>And yet this requirement, which would be an admitted
absurdity in the case of two business partners, is
precisely that which the English common law still lays
down in case of husband and wife. The words which
I employed to describe it, in the preceding sentence,
are the very phrases in which Blackstone describes the
legal position of women. And though the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>common law has been, in this respect, greatly modified
and superseded by statute law; yet, when it comes to
an argument on woman suffrage, it is constantly this
same tradition to which men and even women habitually
appeal,—the necessity of a single head to the domestic
partnership, and the necessity that the husband
should be that head. This is especially true of English
men and women; but it is true of Americans as well.
Nobody has stated it more tersely than Fitzjames
Stephen, in his “Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity”
(p. 216), when arguing against Mr. Mill’s view of the
equality of the sexes.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Marriage is a contract, one of the principal objects in
which is the government of a family.</p>

<p class='c021'>“This government must be vested, either by law or by contract,
in the hands of one of the two married persons.”</p>

<p class='c014'>[Then follow some collateral points, not bearing on
the present question.]</p>

<p class='c021'>“Therefore if marriage is to be permanent, the government
of the family must be put by law and by morals into the
hands of the husband, for no one proposes to give it to the
wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This argument he calls “as clear as that of a proposition
in Euclid.” He thinks that the business of life
can be carried on by no other method. How is it, then,
that when we come to what is called technically and
especially the “business” of every day, this whole finespun
theory is disregarded, and men come together in
partnership on the basis of equality?</p>

<p class='c014'>Nobody is farther than I from regarding marriage as
a mere business partnership. But it is to be observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that the points wherein it differs from a merely mercantile
connection are points that should make equality
more easy, not more difficult. The tie between two
ordinary business partners is merely one of interest: it
is based on no sentiments, sealed by no solemn pledge,
enriched by no home associations, cemented by no new
generation of young life. If a relation like this is
found to work well on terms of equality,—so well that
a large part of the business of the world is done by it,—is
it not absurd to suppose that the same equal relation
cannot exist in the married partnership of husband
and wife? And if law, custom, society, all recognize
this fact of equality in the one case, why, in the name
of common-sense, should they not equally recognize it
in the other?</p>

<p class='c014'>And, again, it must be far easier to assign a sphere
to each partner in marriage than in business; and
therefore the double headship of a family will involve
less need of collision. In nine cases out of ten, the
external support of the family can devolve upon the
husband, unquestioned by the wife; and its internal
economy upon the wife, unquestioned by the husband.
No voluntary distribution of powers and duties between
business partners can work so naturally, on the whole,
as this simple and easy demarcation, with which the
claim of suffrage makes no necessary interference. It
may require angry discussion to decide which of two
business partners shall buy, and which shall sell; which
shall keep the books, and which do the active work,
and so on; but all this is usually settled in married life
by the natural order of things. Even in regard to the
management of children, where collision is likely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>come, if anywhere, it can commonly be settled by that
happy formula of Jean Paul’s, that the mother usually
supplies the commas and the semicolons in the child’s
book of life, and the father the colons and periods.
And as to matters in general, the simple and practical
rule, that each question that arises should be decided
by that partner who has personally most at stake in
it, will, in ninety-nine times out of a hundred, carry
the domestic partnership through without shipwreck.
Those who cannot meet the hundredth case by mutual
forbearance are in a condition of shipwreck already.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>ASKING FOR MONEY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One of the very best wives and mothers I have ever
known once said to me, that, whenever her daughters
should be married, she should stipulate in their behalf
with their husbands for a regular sum of money to be
paid them, at certain intervals, for their personal expenditures.
Whether this sum was to be larger or
smaller, was a matter of secondary importance,—that
must depend on the income, and the style of living;
but the essential thing was, that it should come to the
wife regularly, so that she should no more have to
make a special request for it than her husband would
have to ask her for a dinner. This lady’s own husband
was, as I happened to know, of a most generous
disposition, was devotedly attached to her, and denied
her nothing. She herself was a most accurate and
careful manager. There was every thing in the household
to make the financial arrangements flow smoothly.
Yet she said to me, “I suppose no man can possibly
understand how a sensitive woman shrinks from <em>asking</em>
for money. If I can prevent it, my daughters shall
never have to ask for it. If they do their duty as
wives and mothers they have a right to their share of
the joint income, within reasonable limits; for certainly
no money could buy the services they render.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Moreover, they have a right to a share in determining
what those reasonable limits are.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, it so happened that I had myself gone through
an experience which enabled me perfectly to comprehend
this feeling. In early life I was for a time in the
employ of one of my relatives, who paid me a fair
salary but at no definite periods: I was at liberty to
ask him for money up to a certain amount whenever I
needed it. This seemed to me, in advance, a most
agreeable arrangement; but I found it quite otherwise.
It proved to be very disagreeable to ask for money:
it made every dollar seem a special favor; it brought
up all kinds of misgivings, as to whether he could
spare it without inconvenience, whether he really
thought my services worth it, and so on. My employer
was a thoroughly upright and noble man, and I
was much attached to him. I do not know that he
ever refused or demurred when I asked for money.
The annoyance was simply in the process of asking;
and this became so great, that I often underwent serious
inconvenience rather than ask. Finally, at the
year’s end, I surprised my relative very much by saying
that I would accept, if necessary, a lower salary,
on condition that it should be paid on regular days,
and as a matter of business. The wish was at once
granted, without the reduction; and he probably never
knew what a relief it was to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, if a young man is liable to feel this pride and
reluctance toward an employer, even if a kinsman, it is
easy to understand how many women may feel the same,
even in regard to a husband. And I fancy that those
who feel it most are often the most conscientious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>high-minded women. It is unreasonable to say of such
persons, “Too sensitive! Too fastidious!” For it
is just this quality of finer sensitiveness which men
affect to prize in a woman, and wish to protect at all
hazards. The very fact that a husband is generous;
the very fact that his income is limited,—these may
bring in conscience and gratitude to increase the restraining
influence of pride, and make the wife less
willing to ask money of such a husband than if he
were a rich man or a mean one. The only dignified
position in which a man can place his wife is to treat
her at least as well as he would treat a housekeeper,
and give her the comfort of a perfectly clear and definite
arrangement as to money matters. She will not
then be under the necessity of nerving herself to solicit
from him as a favor what she really needs and has a
right to spend. Nor will she be torturing herself, on
the other side, with the secret fear lest she has asked
too much and more than they can really spare. She
will, in short, be in the position of a woman and a
wife, not of a child or a toy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have carefully avoided using the word “allowance”
in what has been said, because that word seems
to imply the untrue and mean assumption that the
money is all the husband’s to give or withhold as he will.
Yet I have heard this sort of phrase from men who
were living on a wife’s property or a wife’s earnings;
from men who nominally kept boarding-houses, working
a little, while their wives worked hard,—or from
farmers, who worked hard, and made their wives work
harder. Even in cases where the wife has no direct
part in the money-making, the indirect part she performs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>if she takes faithful charge of her household, is
so essential, so beyond all compensation in money,
that it is an utter shame and impertinence in the husband
when he speaks of “giving” money to his wife
as if it were an act of favor. It is no more an act
of favor than when the business manager of a firm
pays out money to the unseen partner who directs the
indoor business or runs the machinery. Be the joint
income more or less, the wife has a claim to her honorable
share, and that as a matter of right, without
the daily ignominy of sending in a petition for it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>WOMANHOOD AND MOTHERHOOD.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I always groan in spirit when any advocate of
woman suffrage, carried away by zeal, says any thing
disrespectful about the nursery. It is contrary to the
general tone of feeling among us, I am sure, to speak
of this priceless institution as a trivial or degrading
sphere, unworthy the emancipated woman. It is
rarely that anybody speaks in this way; but a single
such utterance hurts us more than any arguments of
the enemy. For every thoughtful person sees that the
cares of motherhood, though not the whole duty of
woman, are an essential part of that duty, wherever
they occur; and that no theory of womanly life is
good for any thing which undertakes to leave out the
cradle. Even her school-education is based on this
fact, were it only on Stendhal’s theory that the sons
of a woman who reads Gibbon and Schiller will be
more likely to show talent than those of one who only
tells her beads and reads Mme. de Genlis. And so
clearly is this understood among us, that, when we ask
for suffrage for woman, it is almost always claimed
that she needs it for the sake of her children. To
secure her in her right to them; to give her a voice in
their education; to give her a vote in the government
beneath which they are to live,—these points are seldom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>omitted in our statement of her claims. Any
thing else would be an error.</p>

<p class='c014'>But there is an error at the other extreme, which is
still greater. A woman should no more merge herself
in her child than in her husband. Yet we often hear
that she should do just this. What is all the public
sphere of woman, it is said,—what good can she do
by all her speaking, and writing, and action,—compared
with that she does by properly training the
soul of one child? It is not easy to see the logic of
this claim.</p>

<p class='c014'>For of what service is that child to be in the universe,
except that he, too, may write and speak and act
for that which is good and true? And if the mother
foregoes all this that the child, in growing up, may
simply do what the mother has left undone, the world
gains nothing. In sacrificing her own work to her
child’s, moreover, she exchanges a present good for
a prospective and merely possible one. If she does
this through overwhelming love, we can hardly blame
her; but she cannot justify it before reason and truth.
Her child may die, and the service to mankind be done
by neither. Her child may grow up with talents unlike
hers, or with none at all; as the son of Howard
was selfish, the son of Chesterfield a boor, and the son
of Wordsworth in the last degree prosaic.</p>

<p class='c014'>Or the special occasion when she might have done
great good may have passed before her boy or girl
grows up to do it. If Mrs. Child had refused to write
“An Appeal for that Class of Americans called Africans,”
or Mrs. Stowe had laid aside “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” or Florence Nightingale had declined to go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the Crimea, on the ground that a woman’s true work
was through the nursery, and they must all wait for
that, the consequence would be that these things would
have remained undone. The brave acts of the world
must be done when occasion offers, by the first brave
soul who feels moved to do them, man or woman. If
all the children in all the nurseries are thereby helped
to do other brave deeds when their turn comes, so
much the better. But when a great opportunity offers
for direct aid to the world, we have no right to transfer
that work to other hands—not even to the hands
of our own children. We must do the work, and train
the children besides.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am willing to admit, therefore, that the work of
education, in any form, is as great as any other work;
but I fail to see why it should be greater. Usefulness
is usefulness: there is no reason why it should be postponed
from generation to generation, or why it is better
to rear a serviceable human being than to be one in person.
Carry the theory consistently out: each mother
must simply rear her daughter that she in turn may
rear somebody else; from each generation the work
will devolve upon a succeeding generation, so that it
will be only the last woman who will personally do
any service, except that of motherhood; and when her
time comes it will be too late for any service at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>If it be said, “But some of these children will be
men, who are necessarily of more use than women,” I
deny the necessity. If it be said, “The children may
be many, and the mother, who is but one, may well be
sacrificed,” it might be replied, that as one great act may
be worth many smaller ones, so all the numerous children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and grandchildren of a woman like Lucretia Mott may
not collectively equal the usefulness of herself alone.
If she, like many women, had held it her duty to renounce
all other duties and interests from the time her
motherhood began, I think that the world, and even
her children, would have lost more than ever could
have been gained by her more complete absorption in
the nursery.</p>

<p class='c014'>The true theory seems a very simple one. The very
fact that during one-half the years of a woman’s average
life she is made incapable of child-bearing, shows
that there are, even for the most prolific and devoted
mothers, duties other than the maternal. Even during
the most absorbing years of motherhood, the wisest
women still try to keep up their interest in society, in
literature, in the world’s affairs—were it only for their
children’s sake. Multitudes of women will never be
mothers; and those more fortunate may find even the
usefulness of their motherhood surpassed by what they
do in other ways. If maternal duties interfere in
some degree with all other functions, the same is true,
though in a far less degree, of those of a father. But
there are those who combine both spheres. The German
poet Wieland claimed to be the parent of fourteen
children and forty books; and who knows by
which parentage he served the world the best?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>A GERMAN POINT OF VIEW.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Many Americans will remember the favorable impression
made by Professor Christlieb of Germany,
when he attended the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance
in New York some four or five years ago. His
writings, like his presence, show a most liberal spirit;
and perhaps no man has ever presented the more advanced
evangelical theology of Germany in so attractive
a light. Yet I heard a story of him the other
day, which either showed him in an aspect quite undesirable,
or else gave a disagreeable view of the social
position of women in Germany.</p>

<p class='c014'>The story was to the effect, that a young American
student recently called on Professor Christlieb with a
letter of introduction. The professor received him cordially,
and soon entered into conversation about the
United States. He praised the natural features of the
country, and the enterprising spirit of our citizens, but
expressed much solicitude about the future of the nation.
On being asked his reasons, he frankly expressed
his opinion that “the Spirit of Christ” was
not here. Being still further pressed to illustrate his
meaning, he gave, as instances of this deficiency, not
the Crédit Mobilier or the Tweed scandal, but such
alarming facts as the following. He seriously declared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>that, on more than one occasion, he had heard an
American married woman say to her husband, “Dear,
will you bring me my shawl?” and the husband had
brought it. He further had seen a husband return
home at evening, and enter the parlor where his wife
was sitting,—perhaps in the very best chair in the
room,—and the wife not only did not go and get
his dressing-gown and slippers, but she even remained
seated, and left him to find a chair as he could. These
things, as Professor Christlieb pointed out, suggested a
serious deficiency of the Spirit of Christ in the community.</p>

<p class='c014'>With our American habits and interpretations, it is
hard to see this matter just as the professor sees it.
One would suppose, that, if there is any meaning in the
command, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so
fulfil the law of Christ,” a little of such fulfilling
might sometimes be good for the husband, as for the
wife. And though it would undoubtedly be more
pleasing to see every wife so eager to receive her
husband that she would naturally spring from her chair
and run to kiss him in the doorway, yet, where such
devotion was wanting, it would be but fair to inquire
which of the two had had the more fatiguing day’s
work, and to whom the easy-chair justly belonged.
The truth is, I suppose, that the good professor’s
remark indicated simply a “survival” in his mind, or
in his social circle, of a barbarous tradition, under
which the wife of a Mexican herdsman cannot eat at
the table with her “lord and master,” and the wife of
a German professor must vacate the best arm-chair at
his approach.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>If so, it is not to be regretted that we in this country
have outgrown a relation so unequal. Nor am I at all
afraid that the great Teacher, who, pointing to the
multitude for whom he was soon to die, said of them,
“This is my brother and my sister and my mother,”
would have objected to any mutual and equal service
between man and woman. If we assume that two
human beings have immortal souls, there can be no
want of dignity to either in serving the other. The
greater equality of woman in America seems to be, on
this reasoning, a proof of the presence, not the absence,
of the spirit of Christ; nor does Dr. Christlieb seem to
me quite worthy of the beautiful name he bears, if he
feels otherwise.</p>

<p class='c014'>But, if it is really true that a German professor has
to cross the Atlantic to witness a phenomenon so very
simple as that of a lover-like husband bringing a shawl
for his wife, I should say, Let the immigration from
Germany be encouraged as much as possible, in order
that even the most learned immigrants may discover
something new.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>CHILDLESS WOMEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It has not always been regarded as a thing creditable
to woman, that she was the mother of the human
race. On the contrary, the fact was often mentioned,
in the Middle Ages, as a distinct proof of inferiority.
The question was discussed in the mediæval Council of
Maçon, and the position taken that woman was no more
entitled to rank as human, because she brought forth
men, than the garden-earth could take rank with the
fruit and flowers it bore. The same view was revived
by a Latin writer of 1595, on the thesis “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mulieres non
homines esse</span></i>,” a French translation of which essay was
printed under the title of “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paradoxe sur les femmes</span></i>,”
in 1766. Napoleon Bonaparte used the same image,
carrying it almost as far:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Woman is given to man that she may bear children.
Woman is our property; we are not hers: because she
produces children for us; we do not yield any to her:
she is therefore our possession, as the fruit-tree is that
of the gardener.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Even the fact of parentage, therefore, has been
adroitly converted into a ground of inferiority for
women; and this is ostensibly the reason why lineage
has been reckoned, almost everywhere, through the
male line only, ignoring the female; just as, in tracing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the seed of some rare fruit, the gardener takes no
genealogical account of the garden where it grew.
The view is now seldom expressed in full force: the
remnant of it is to be found in the lingering impression,
that, at any rate, a woman who is not a mother is of
no account; as worthless as a fruitless garden or a
barren fruit-tree. Created only for a certain object,
she is of course valueless unless that object be fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the race must have fathers as well as mothers;
and, if we look for evidence of public service in great
men, it certainly does not always lie in leaving children
to the republic. On the contrary, the rule has rather
seemed to be, that the most eminent men have left their
bequest of service in any form rather than in that of a
great family. Recent inquiries into the matter have
brought out some remarkable facts in this regard.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a rule, there exist no living descendants in the
male line from the great authors, artists, statesmen,
soldiers, of England. It is stated that there is not one
such descendant of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Butler,
Dryden, Pope, Cowper, Goldsmith, Scott, Byron,
or Moore; not one of Drake, Cromwell, Monk, Marlborough,
Peterborough, or Nelson; not one of Strafford,
Ormond, or Clarendon; not one of Addison, Swift, or
Johnson; not one of Walpole, Bolingbroke, Chatham,
Pitt, Fox, Burke, Grattan, or Canning; not one of
Bacon, Locke, Newton, or Davy; not one of Hume,
Gibbon, or Macaulay; not one of Hogarth or Reynolds;
not one of Garrick, John Kemble, or Edmund Kean.
It would be easy to make a similar American list, beginning
with Washington, of whom it was said that
“Providence made him childless that his country might
call him Father.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Now, however we may regret that these great men
have left little or no posterity, it does not occur to any
one as affording any serious drawback upon their service
to their nation. Certainly it does not occur to us
that they would have been more useful had they left
children to the world, but rendered it no other service.
Lord Bacon says that “he that hath wife and children
hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments
to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.
Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit to
the public, have proceeded from unmarried or childless
men; which, both in affection and means, have married
and endowed the public.” And this is the view generally
accepted,—that the public is in such cases rather
the gainer than the loser, and has no right to complain.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since, therefore, every child must have a father and
a mother both, and neither will alone suffice, why should
we thus heap gratitude on men who from preference
or from necessity have remained childless, and yet
habitually treat women as if they could render no service
to their country except by giving it children? If
it be folly and shame, as I think, to belittle and decry
the dignity and worth of motherhood, as some are said
to do, it is no less folly, and shame quite as great, to
deny the grand and patriotic service of many women who
have died and left no children among their mourners.
Plato puts into the mouth of a woman,—the eloquent
Diotima, in the “Banquet,”—that, after all, we are
more grateful to Homer and Hesiod for the children of
their brain than if they had left human offspring.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XXXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO MOTHERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>From the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals we have now advanced to a similar society for
the benefit of children. When shall we have a movement
for the prevention of cruelty to mothers?</p>

<p class='c014'>A Rhode Island lady, who had never taken any
interest in the woman suffrage movement, came to me
in great indignation the other day, asking if it was
true that under Rhode Island laws a husband might,
by his last will, bequeath his child away from its
mother, so that she might, if the guardian chose, never
see it again. I said that it was undoubtedly true, and
that such were still the laws in many States of the
Union.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But,” she said, “it is an outrage. The husband
may have been one of the weakest or worst men in
the world; he may have persecuted his wife and children;
he may have made the will in a moment of
anger, and have neglected to alter it. At any rate, he
is dead, and the mother is living. The guardian whom
he appoints may turn out a very malicious man, and
may take pleasure in torturing the mother; or he may
bring up the children in a way their mother thinks ruinous
for them. Why do not all the mothers cry out
against such a law?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“I wish they would,” I said. “I have been trying
a good many years to make them even understand what
the law is; but they do not. People who do not vote
pay no attention to the laws, until they suffer from
them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She went away protesting that she, at least, would
not hold her tongue on the subject, and I hope she will
not. The actual text of the law is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Every person authorized by law to make a will, except
married women, shall have a right to appoint by his will a
guardian or guardians for his children during their minority.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Gen. Statutes R. I., chap. 154, sect. 1.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is not associated with this, in the statute, the
slightest clause in favor of the mother; nor any thing
which could limit the power of the guardian by requiring
deference to her wishes, although he could, in case
of gross neglect or abuse, be removed by the court, and
another guardian appointed. There is not a line of
positive law to protect the mother. Now, in a case of
absolute wrong, a single sentence of law is worth all
the chivalrous courtesy this side of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is idle to say that such laws are not executed.
They are executed. I have had letters, too agonizing
to print, expressing the sufferings of mothers under
laws like these. There lies before me a letter,—not
from Rhode Island,—written by a widowed mother
who suffers daily tortures, even while in possession of
her child, at the knowledge that it is not legally hers,
but held only by the temporary permission of the
guardian appointed under her husband’s will. “I beg
you,” she says, “to take this will to the hill-top, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>urge law-makers in our next Legislature to free the
State record from the shameful story that no mother
can control her child unless it is born out of wedlock.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“From the moment,” she says, “when the will was
read to me, I have made no effort to set it aside. I
wait till God reveals his plans, so far as my own condition
is concerned. But out of my keen comprehension
of this great wrong, notwithstanding my submission for
myself, my whole soul is stirred,—for my child, who
is a little woman; for all women, that the laws may be
changed which subject a true woman, a devoted wife,
a faithful mother, to such mental agonies as I have
endured, and shall endure till I die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In a later letter she says, “I now have his [the
guardian’s] solemn promise that he will not remove her
from my control. To some extent my sufferings are
allayed; and yet never, till she arrives at the age of
twenty-one, shall I fully trust.” I wish that mothers
who dwell in sheltered and happy homes would try to
bring to their minds the condition of a mother whose
possession of her only child rests upon the “promise”
of a comparative stranger. We should get beyond
the meaningless cry, “I have all the rights I want,” if
mothers could only remember that among these rights,
in most States of the Union, the right of a widowed
mother to her child is not included.</p>

<p class='c014'>By strenuous effort, the law on this point has in
Massachusetts been gradually amended, till it now
stands thus: The father is authorized to appoint a
guardian by will; but the powers of this guardian do
not entitle him to take the child from the mother.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“The guardian of a minor&nbsp;... shall have the custody and
tuition of his ward; and the care and management of all his
estate, except that the father of the minor, if living, and in
case of his death the mother, they being respectively competent
to transact their own business, shall be entitled to the custody
of the person of the minor and the care of his education.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Public Statutes, chap. 139, sect. 4.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Down to 1870 the cruel words “while she remains
unmarried” followed the word “mother” in the above
law. Until that time, the mother if remarried had no
claim to the custody of her child, in case the guardian
wished otherwise; and a very painful scene once took
place in a Boston court-room, where children were
forced away from their mother by the officers, under
this statute; in spite of her tears and theirs; and this
when no sort of personal charge had been made against
her. This could not now happen in Massachusetts, but
it might still happen in some other States. It is true
that men are almost always better than their laws; but,
while a bad law remains on the statute-book, it gives to
any unscrupulous man the power to be as bad as the
law.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XL.<br /> <span class='large'>FOAM AND CURRENT.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes, on the beach at Newport, I look at the
gayly dressed ladies in their phaëtons, and then at the
foam which trembles on the breaking wave, or lies palpitating
in creamy masses on the beach. It is as pretty
as they, as light, as fresh, as delicate, as changing;
and no doubt the graceful foam, if it thinks at all,
fancies that it is the chief consummate product of the
ocean, and that the main end of the vast currents of
the mighty deep is to yield a few glittering bubbles
like those. At least, this seems to me what many of
the fair ladies think.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is a nation in which the most momentous social
and political experiment ever tried by man is being
worked out, day by day. There is something oceanlike
in the way in which the great currents of life, race,
religion, temperament, are here chafing with each other,
safe from the storms through which all monarchical
countries may yet have to pass. As these great currents
heave, there are tossed up in every watering-place
and every city in America, as on an ocean-beach, certain
pretty bubbles of foam; and each spot, we may
suppose, counts its own bubbles brighter than those of
its neighbors, and christens them “society.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is an unceasing wonder to a thoughtful person, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>any such resort, to see the unconscious way in which
fashionable society accepts the foam, and ignores the
currents. You hear people talk of “a position in society,”
“the influential circles in society,” as if the position
they mean were not liable to be shifted in a day;
as if the essential influences in America were not mainly
to be sought outside the world of fashion. In other
countries it is very different. The circle of social caste,
whose centre you touch in London, radiates to the
shores of the island; the upper class controls, not
merely fashion, but government; it rules in country
as well as city; genius and wealth are but its tributaries.
Wherever it is not so, it is because England is
so far Americanized. But in America the social prestige
of the cities is nothing in the country; it is a
matter of the pavement, of a three-mile radius.</p>

<p class='c014'>Go to the farthest borders of England: there are still
the “county families,” and you meet servants in livery.
On the other hand, in a little village in Northern New
Hampshire, my friend was visited in the evening by the
landlady, who said that several of their “most fashionable
ladies” had happened in, and she would like to
exhibit to them her guest’s bonnet. Then the different
cities ignore each other: the rulers of select circles in
New York find themselves nobodies in Washington,
while a Washington social passport counts for as little
in New York. Boston and Philadelphia affect to ignore
both; and St. Louis and San Francisco have their own
standards. The utmost social prestige in America is
local, provincial, a matter of the square inch: it is as
if the foam of each particular beach along the seacoast
were to call itself “society.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>There is something pathetic, therefore, in the unwearied
pains taken by ambitious women to establish a place
in some little, local, transitory domain, to “bring out”
their daughters for exhibition on a given evening, to
form a circle for them, to marry them well. A dozen
years hence the millionnaires whose notice they seek
may be paupers, or these ladies may be dwelling in
some other city, where the visiting cards will bear
wholly different names. How idle to attempt to transport
into American life the social traditions and delusions
which require monarchy and primogeniture, and
a standing army, to keep them up—and which cannot
hold their own in England, even with the aid of these!</p>

<p class='c014'>Every woman, like every man, has a natural desire
for influence; and if this instinct yearns, as it often
should yearn, to take in more than her own family, she
must seek it somewhere outside. I know women who
bring to bear on the building-up of a frivolous social
circle—frivolous, because it is not really brilliant, but
only showy; not really gay, but only bored—talent and
energy enough to influence the mind and thought of the
nation, if only employed in some effective way. Who
are the women of real influence in America? They are
the school-teachers, through whose hands each successive
American generation has to pass; they are those
wives of public men who share their husbands’ labor,
and help mould their work; they are those women, who,
through their personal eloquence or through the press,
are distinctly influencing the American people in its
growth. The influence of such women is felt for good
or for evil in every page they print, every newspaper-column
they fill: the individual women may be unworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>their posts, but it is they who have got hold of
the lever, and gone the right way to work. As American
society is constituted, the largest “social success”
that can be attained here is trivial and local; and you
have to “make believe very hard,” like that other
imaginary Marchioness, to find in it any career worth
mentioning. That is the foam, but these other women
are dealing with the main currents.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLI.<br /> <span class='large'>“IN SOCIETY.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One sometimes hears from some lady the remark
that very few people “in society” believe in any
movement to enlarge the rights or duties of women.
In a community of more marked social gradations
than our own, this assertion, if true, might be very
important; and even here it is worth considering, because
it leads the way to a little social philosophy.
Let us, for the sake of argument, begin by accepting
the assumption that there is an inner circle, at least in
our large cities, which claims to be “society,” <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</span></i>. What relation has this favored circle, if
favored it be, to any movement relating to women?</p>

<p class='c014'>It has, to begin with, the same relation that “society”
has to every movement of reform. The proportion
of smiles and frowns offered from this quarter
to the woman-suffrage movement, for instance, is about
that offered to the anti-slavery agitation: I see no
great difference. In Boston, for example, the names
contributed by “society” to the woman-suffrage festivals
are about as numerous as those formerly contributed
to the anti-slavery bazaars; no more, no less.
Indeed, they are very often the same names; and it has
been curious to see, for nearly fifty years, how radical
tendencies have predominated in some of the wellknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Boston families, and conservative tendencies in
others. The traits of blood seem to outlast successive
series of special reforms. Be this as it may,
it is safe to assume, that, as the anti-slavery movement
prevailed with only a moderate amount of sanction
from “our best society,” the woman-suffrage movement,
which has at least an equal amount, has no
reason to be discouraged.</p>

<p class='c014'>But on looking farther, we find that not reforms
alone, but often most important and established institutions,
exist and flourish with only incidental aid from
those “in society.” Take, for instance, the whole public-school
system of our larger cities. Grant that out of
twenty ladies “in society,” taken at random, not more
than one would personally approve of women’s voting:
it is doubtful whether even that proportion of them
would personally favor the public-school system so far
as to submit their children, or at least their girls, to it.
Yet the public schools flourish, and give a better training
than most private schools, in spite of this inert
practical resistance from those “in society.” The
natural inference would seem to be, that if an institution
so well established as the public schools, and so
generally recognized, can afford to be ignored by “society,”
then certainly a wholly new reform must expect
no better fate.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a matter of fact, I apprehend that what is called
“society,” in the sense of the more fastidious or exclusive
social circle in any community, exists for one
sole object,—the preservation of good manners and
social refinements. For this purpose it is put very
largely under the sway of women, who have, all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>world over, a better instinct for these important things.
It is true that “society” is apt to do even this duty
very imperfectly, and often tolerates, and sometimes
even cultivates, just the rudeness and discourtesy that
it is set to cure. Nevertheless, this is its mission; but
so soon as it steps beyond this, and attempts to claim
any special weight outside the sphere of good manners,
it shows its weakness, and must yield to stronger
forces.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of these stronger forces is religion, which should
train men and women to a far higher standard than
“society” alone can teach. This standard should be
embodied, theoretically, in the Christian Church; but
unhappily “society” is too often stronger than this
embodiment, and turns the church itself into a mere
temple of fashion. Other opposing forces are known
as science and common-sense, which is only science
written in short-hand. On some of these various
forces all reforms are based, the woman-suffrage reform
among them. If it could really be shown that
some limited social circle was opposed to this, then the
moral would seem to be, “So much the worse for the
social circle.” It used to be thought in anti-slavery
days that one of the most blessed results of that agitation
was the education it gave to young men and
women who would otherwise have merely grown up
“in society,” but were happily taken in hand by a
stronger influence. It is Goethe who suggests, when
discussing Hamlet in “Wilhelm Meister,” that, if an
oak be planted in a flower-pot, it will be worse in the
end for the flower-pot than for the tree. And to those
who watch, year after year, the young human seedlings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>planted “in society,” the main point of interest lies in
the discovery which of these are likely to grow into
oaks.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the truth is, that the very use of the word
“society” in this sense is narrow and misleading.
We Americans are fortunate enough to live in a larger
society, where no conventional position or family traditions
exert an influence that is to be in the least degree
compared with the influence secured by education,
energy, and character. No matter how fastidious the
social circle, one is constantly struck with the limitations
of its influence, and with the little power exerted
by its members as compared with that which may easily
be wielded by tongue and pen. No merely fashionable
woman in New York, for instance, has a position
sufficiently important to be called influential compared
with that of a woman who can speak in public so as to
command hearers, or can write so as to secure readers.
To be at the head of a normal school, or to be a professor
in a college where co-education prevails, is to
have a sway over the destinies of America which reduces
all mere “social position” to a matter of cards
and compliments and page’s buttons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BATTLE OF THE CARDS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The great winter’s contest of the visiting-cards recommences
at the end of every autumn. Suspended
during the summer, or only renewed at Newport and
such thoroughbred and thoroughly sophisticated haunts,
it will set in with fury in the habitable regions of our
cities once more. Now will the atmosphere around
Fifth Avenue in New York be darkened—or whitened—at
the appointed hour by the shower of pasteboard
transmitted from dainty kid-gloved hands to the cotton-gloved
hands of “John,” through him to reach the
possibly gloveless hands of some other John, who stands
obsequious in the doorway. Now will every lady, after
John has slammed the door, drive happily on to some
other door, re-arranging, as she goes, her display of
cards, laid as if for a game on the opposite seat of her
carriage, and dealt perhaps in four suits,—her own
cards, her daughters’, her husband’s, her “Mr. and
Mrs.” cards, and who knows how many more? With
all this ammunition, what a very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mitrailleuse</span></i> of good
society she becomes; what an accumulation of polite
attentions she may discharge at any door! That one
well-appointed woman, as she sits in her carriage,
represents the total visiting power of self, husband,
daughters, and possibly a son or two beside. She has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>all their counterfeit presentments in her hands. How
happy she is! and how happy will the others be on her
return, to think that dear mamma has disposed of so
many dear, beloved, tiresome, social foes that morning!
It will be three months at least, they think, before the
A’s and the B’s and the C’s will have to be “done”
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ah! but who knows how soon these fatiguing letters
of the alphabet, rallying to the defence, will come,
pasteboard in hand, to return the onset? In this contest,
fair ladies, “there are blows to take, as well as
blows to give,” in the words of the immortal Webster.
Some day, on returning, you will find a half-dozen
cards on your own table that will undo all this morning’s
work, and send you forth on the war-path again.
Is it not like a campaign? It is from this subtle military
analogy, doubtless, that when gentlemen happen
to quarrel, in the very best society, they exchange
cards as preliminary to a duel; and that, when French
journalists fight, all other French journalists show their
sympathy for the survivor by sending him their cards.
When we see, therefore, these heroic ladies riding forth
in the social battle’s magnificently stern array, our
hearts render them the homage due to the brave.
When we consider how complex their military equipment
has grown, we fancy each of these self-devoted
mothers to be an Arnold Winkelried, receiving in her
martyr-breast the points of a dozen different cards,
and shouting, “Make way for liberty!” For is it not
securing liberty to have cleared off a dozen calls from
your list, and found nobody at home?</p>

<p class='c014'>If this sort of thing goes on, who can tell where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>paper warfare shall end? If ladies may leave cards
for their husbands, who are never seen out of Wall
Street, except when they are seen at their clubs; or
for their sons, who never forsake their billiards or their
books,—why can they not also leave them for their
ancestors, or for their remotest posterity? Who knows
but people may yet drop cards in the names of the
grandchildren whom they only wish for, or may reconcile
hereditary feuds by interchanging pasteboard in
behalf of two hostile grandparents who died half a
century ago?</p>

<p class='c014'>And there is another social observance in which the
introduction of the card system may yet be destined
to save much labor,—the attendance on fashionable
churches. Already, it is said, a family may sometimes
reconcile devout observance with a late breakfast, by
stationing the family carriage near the church-door—empty.
Really, it would not be a much emptier observance
to send the cards alone by the footman; and
doubtless, in the progress of civilization, we shall yet
reach that point. It will have many advantages. The
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">effete</span></i> of society, as some cruel satirist has called them,
may then send their orisons on pasteboard to as many
different shrines as they approve; thus insuring their
souls, as it were, at several different offices. Church
architecture may be simplified, for it will require nothing
but a card-basket. The clergyman will celebrate
his solemn ritual, and will then look in that convenient
receptacle for the names of his fellow worshippers, as a
fine lady, after her “reception,” looks over the cards
her footman hands her, to know which of her dear
friends she has been welcoming. Religion as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>social proprieties will glide smoothly over a surface of
glazed pasteboard; and it will be only very humble
Christians indeed who will do their worshipping in person,
and will hold to the worn-out and obsolete practice
of “No Cards.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XLIII.<br /> <span class='large'>SOME WORKING-WOMEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is almost a stereotyped remark, that the women of
the more fashionable and worldly class, in America, are
indolent, idle, incapable, and live feeble and lazy lives.
It has always seemed to me that, on the contrary,
they are compelled, by the very circumstances of their
situation, to lead very laborious lives, requiring great
strength and energy. Whether many of their pursuits
are frivolous, is a different question; but that they are
arduous, I do not see how any one can doubt. I think
it can be easily shown that the common charges against
American fashionable women do not hold against the
class I describe.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is, for instance, the charge of evading the
cares of housekeeping, and of preferring a boarding-house
or hotel. But no woman with high aims in the
world of fashion can afford to relieve herself from
household cares in this way, except as an exceptional
or occasional thing. She must keep house in order to
have entertainments, to form a circle, to secure a position.
The law of give and take is as absolute in society
as in business; and the very first essential to social
position in our larger cities is a household and a hospitality
of one’s own. It is far more practicable for a
family of high rank in England to live temporarily in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>lodgings in London, than for any family with social
aspirations to do the same in New York. The married
woman who seeks a position in the world of society,
must, therefore, keep house.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, with housekeeping, there comes at once to the
American woman a world of care far beyond that of
her European sisters. Abroad, every thing in domestic
life is systematized; and services of any grade, up to
that of housekeeper or steward, can be secured for
money, and for a moderate amount of that. The mere
amount of money might not trouble the American woman;
but where to get the service? Such a thing as a
trained housekeeper, who can undertake, at any salary,
to take the work off the shoulders of the lady of the
house,—such a thing America hardly affords. Without
this, the multiplication of servants only increaseth
sorrow; the servants themselves are commonly an undisciplined
mob, and the lady of the house is like a
general attempting to drill his whole command personally,
without the aid of a staff-officer or so much as a
sergeant. For an occasional grand entertainment, she
can, perhaps, import a special force; some fashionable
sexton can arrange her invitations, and some genteel
caterer her supper. But for the daily routine of the
household—guests, children, door-bell, equipage—there
is one vast, constant toil every day; and the
woman who would have these things done well must
give her own orders, and discipline her own retinue.
The husband may have no “business,” his wealth may
supersede the necessity of all toil beyond daily billiards;
but for the wife wealth means business, and,
the more complete the social triumph, the more overwhelming
the daily toil.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>For instance, I know a fair woman in an Atlantic
city who is at the head of a household including six
children and nine servants. The whole domestic management
is placed absolutely in her hands: she engages
or dismisses every person employed, incurs every expense,
makes every purchase, and keeps all the accounts;
her husband only ordering the fuel, directing
the affairs of the stable, and drawing checks for the
bills. Every hour of her morning is systematically appropriated
to these things. Among other things, she
has to provide for nine meals a day; in dining-room,
kitchen, and nursery, three each. Then she has to plan
her social duties, and to drive out, exquisitely dressed,
to make her calls. Then there are constantly dinner-parties
and evening entertainments; she reads a little,
and takes lessons in one or two languages. Meanwhile
her husband has for daily occupation his books, his
club, and the above-mentioned light and easy share
in the cares of the household. Many men in his
position do not even keep an account of personal
expenditures.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is nothing exceptional in this lady’s case, except
that the work may be better done than usual: the
husband could not well contribute more than his present
share without hurting domestic discipline; nor does
the wife do all this from pleasure, but in a manner from
necessity. It is the condition of her social position:
to change it, she must withdraw herself from her social
world. A few improvements, such as “family hotels,”
are doing something to relieve this class to whom luxury
means labor. The great under-current which is
sweeping us all toward some form of associated life is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>as obvious in this new improvement in housekeeping, as
in co-operative stores or trades-unions; but it will
nevertheless be long before the “women of society”
in America can be any thing but a hard-working class.</p>

<p class='c014'>The question is not whether such a life as I have
described is the ideal life. My point is that it is, at
any rate, a life demanding far more of energy and toil,
at least in America, than the men of the same class are
called upon to exhibit. There is growing up a class of
men of leisure in America; but there are no women
of leisure in the same circle. They hold their social
position on condition of “an establishment,” and an
establishment makes them working-women. One result
is the constant exodus of this class to Europe,
where domestic life is just now easier. Another consequence
is, that you hear woman suffrage denounced by
women of this class, not on the ground that it involves
any harder work than they already do, but on the
ground that they have work enough already, and will
not bear the suggestion of any more.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE EMPIRE OF MANNERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I was present at a lively discourse, administered by
a young lady just from Europe to a veteran politician.
“It is of very little consequence,” she said, “what
kind of men you send out as foreign ministers. The
thing of real importance is that they should have the
right kind of wives. Any man can sign a treaty, I
suppose, if you tell him what kind of treaty it must be.
But all his social relations with the nations to which
you send him will depend on his wife.” There was
some truth, certainly, in this audacious conclusion. It
reminded me of the saying of a modern thinker, “The
only empire freely conceded to women is that of manners—but
it is worth all the rest put together.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Every one instinctively feels that the graces and
amenities of life must be largely under the direction of
women. The fact that this feeling has been carried
too far, and has led to the dwarfing of women’s intellect,
must not lead to a rejection of this important
social sphere. It is too strong a power to be ignored.
George Eliot says well that “the commonest man, who
has his ounce of sense and feeling, is conscious of the
difference between a lovely, delicate woman, and a
coarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in their
presence.” At a summer resort, for instance, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>sees women who may be intellectually very ignorant
and narrow, yet whose mere manners give them a
social power which the highest intellects might envy.
To lend joy and grace to all one’s little world of friendship;
to make one’s house a place which every guest
enters with eagerness, and leaves with reluctance; to
lend encouragement to the timid, and ease to the awkward;
to repress violence, restrain egotism, and make
even controversy courteous,—these belong to the empire
of woman. It is a sphere so important and so
beautiful, that even courage and self-devotion seem not
quite enough, without the addition of this supremest
charm.</p>

<p class='c014'>This courtesy is so far from implying falsehood, that
its very best basis is perfect simplicity. Given a naturally
sensitive organization, a loving spirit, and the
early influence of a refined home, and the foundation of
fine manners is secured. A person so favored may be
reared in a log-hut, and may pass easily into a palace;
the few needful conventionalities are so readily acquired.
But I think it is a mistake to tell children, as
we sometimes do, that simplicity and a kind heart are
absolutely all that are needful in the way of manners.
There are persons in whom simplicity and kindness are
inborn, and who yet never attain to good manners for
want of refined perceptions. And it is astonishing
how much refinement alone can do, even if it is not
very genuine or very full of heart, to smooth the paths
and make social life attractive.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the acute observers have recognized the difference
between the highest standard, which is nature’s, and
that next to the highest, which is art’s. George Eliot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>speaks of that fine polish which is “the expensive
substitute for simplicity,” and Tennyson says of manners,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Kind nature’s are the best: those next to best</div>
      <div class='line'>That fit us like a nature second-hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which are indeed the manners of the great.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In our own national history, we have learned to recognize
that the personal demeanor of women may be a
social and political force. The slave-power owed much
of its prolonged control at Washington, and the larger
part of its favor in Europe, to the fact that the manners
of Southern women had been more sedulously trained
than those of Northern women. Even at this moment,
one may see at any watering-place that the relative social
influence of different cities does not depend upon
the intellectual training of their women, so much as
on the manners. And, even if this is very unreasonable,
the remedy would seem to be, not to go about lecturing
on the intrinsic superiority of the Muses to the Graces,
but to pay due homage at all the shrines.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a great deal to ask of reformers, especially, that
they should be ornamental as well as useful; and I
would by no means indorse the views of a lady who
once told me that she was ready to adopt the most
radical views of the women-reformers if she could see
one well-dressed woman who accepted them. The place
where we should draw the line between independence
and deference, between essentials and non-essentials,
between great ideas and little courtesies, will probably
never be determined—except by actual examples.
Yet it is safe to fall back on Miss Edgeworth’s maxim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>in “Helen,” that “Every one who makes goodness disagreeable
commits high treason against virtue.” And
it is not a pleasant result of our good deeds, that others
should be immediately driven into bad deeds by the
burning desire to be unlike us.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLV.<br /> <span class='large'>“GIRLSTEROUSNESS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>They tell the story of a little boy, a young scion
of the house of Beecher, that, on being rebuked for
some noisy proceeding, in which his little sister had
also shared, he claimed that she also should be included
in the indictment. “If a boy makes too much
noise,” he said, “you tell him he mustn’t be boisterous.
Well, then, when a girl makes just as much noise,
you ought to tell her not to be <em>girlsterous</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I think that we should accept, with a sense of gratitude,
this addition to the language. It supplies a name
for a special phase of feminine demeanor, inevitably
brought out of modern womanhood. Any transitional
state of society develops some evil with the good.
Good results are unquestionably proceeding from the
greater freedom now allowed to women. The drawback
is, that we are developing, here and now, more of
“girlsterousness” than is apt to be seen in less-enlightened
countries.</p>

<p class='c014'>The more complete the subjection of woman, the
more “subdued” in every sense she is. The typical
woman of savage life is, at least in youth, gentle, shy,
retiring, timid. A Bedouin woman is modest and humble;
an Indian girl has a voice “gentle and low.”
The utmost stretch of the imagination cannot picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>either of them as “girlsterous.” That perilous quality
can only come as woman is educated, self-respecting,
emancipated. “Girlsterousness” is the excess attendant
on that virtue, the shadow which accompanies that
light. It is more visible in England than in France,
in America than in England.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is to be observed, that, if a girl wishes to be noisy,
she can be as noisy as anybody. Her noise, if less
clamorous, is more shrill and penetrating. The shrieks
of schoolgirls, playing in the yard at recess-time, seem
to drown the voices of the boys. As you enter an evening
party, it is the women’s tones you hear most conspicuously.
There is no defect in the organ, but at
least an adequate vigor. In travelling by rail, when
sitting near some rather under-bred party of youths
and damsels, I have commonly noticed that the girls
were the noisiest. The young men appeared more regardful
of public opinion, and looked round with solicitude,
lest they should attract too much attention. It is
“girlsterousness” that dashes straight on, regardless
of all observers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course reformers exhibit their full share of this
undesirable quality. Where the emancipation of women
is much discussed in any circle, some young girls
will put it in practice gracefully and with dignity,
others rudely. Yet even the rudeness may be but a
temporary phase, and at last end well. When women
were being first trained as physicians, years ago, I remember
a young girl who came from a Southern State
to a Northern city, and attended the medical lectures.
Having secured her lecture-tickets, she also bought
season-tickets to the theatre and to the pistol-gallery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>laid in a box of cigars, and began her professional training.
If she meant it as a satire on the pursuits of the
young gentlemen around her, it was not without point.
But it was, I suppose, a clear case of “girlsterousness;”
and I dare say that she sowed her wild oats
much more innocently than many of her male contemporaries,
and that she has long since become a sedate
matron. But I certainly cannot commend her as a
model.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet I must resolutely deny that any sort of hoydenishness
or indecorum is an especial characteristic of
radicals, or even “provincials,” as a class. Some of
the fine ladies who would be most horrified at the “girlsterousness”
of this young maiden would themselves
smoke their cigarettes in much worse company, morally
speaking, than she ever tolerated. And, so far as manners
are concerned, I am bound to say that the worst
cases of rudeness and ill-breeding that have ever come
to my knowledge have not occurred in the “rural districts,”
or among the lower ten thousand, but in those
circles of America where the whole aim in life might
seem to be the cultivation of its elegances.</p>

<p class='c014'>And what confirms me in the fear that the most
profound and serious types of this disease are not to
be found in the wildcat regions is the fact that so much
of is transplanted to Europe, among those who have
the money to travel. It is there described broadly as
“Americanism;” and, so surely as any peculiarly
shrill group is heard coming through a European picture-gallery,
it is straightway classed by all observers
as belonging to the great Republic. If the observers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>are enamoured at sight with the beauty of the young
ladies of the party, they excuse the voices;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Strange or wild, or madly gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>They call it only pretty Fanny’s way.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But other observers are more apt to call it only Columbia’s
way; and if they had ever heard the word “girlsterousness,”
they would use that too.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emerson says, “A gentleman makes no noise; a lady
is serene.” If we Americans often violate this perfect
maxim of good manners, it is something that America
has, at least, furnished the maxim. And, between Emerson
and “girlsterousness,” our courteous philosopher
will yet carry the day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLVI.<br /> <span class='large'>ARE WOMEN NATURAL ARISTOCRATS?</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A clergyman’s wife in England has lately set on
foot a reform movement in respect to dress; and, like
many English reformers, she aims chiefly to elevate the
morals and manners of the lower classes, without much
reference to her own social equals. She proposes that
“no servant, under pain of dismissal, shall wear flowers,
feathers, brooches, buckles or clasps, ear-rings, lockets,
neck-ribbons, velvets, kid gloves, parasols, sashes,
jackets, or trimming of any kind on dresses, and, above
all, no crinoline; no pads to be worn, or frisettes, or
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chignons</span></i>, or hair-ribbons. The dress is to be gored
and made just to touch the ground, and the hair to be
drawn closely to the head, under a round white cap,
without trimming of any kind. The same system of
dress is recommended for Sunday-school girls, school-mistresses,
church-singers, and the lower orders generally.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The remark is obvious, that in this country such
a course of discipline would involve the mistress, not
the maid, in the “pain of dismissal.” The American
clergyman and clergyman’s wife who should even “recommend”
such a costume to a school-mistress, church-singer,
or Sunday-school girl,—to say nothing of the
rest of the “lower orders,”—would soon find themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>without teachers, without pupils, without a choir,
and probably without a parish. It is a comfort to
think that even in older countries there is less and less
of this impertinent interference: the costume of different
ranks is being more and more assimilated; and the
incidental episode of a few liveries in our cities is not
enough to interfere with the general current. Never
yet, to my knowledge, have I seen even a livery worn
by a white native American; and to restrain the Sunday
bonnets of her handmaidens, what lady has attempted?</p>

<p class='c014'>This is as it should be. The Sunday bonnet of the
Irish damsel is only the symbol of a very proper effort
to obtain her share of all social advantages. Long may
those ribbons wave! Meanwhile I think the fact that
it is easier for the gentleman of the house to control the
dress of his groom than for the lady to dictate that of
her waiting-maid,—this must count against the theory
that it is women who are the natural aristocrats.</p>

<p class='c014'>Women are no doubt more sensitive than men upon
matters of taste and breeding. This is partly from
a greater average fineness of natural perception, and
partly because their more secluded lives give them less
of miscellaneous contact with the world. If Maud
Müller and her husband had gone to board at the same
boarding-house with the Judge and his wife, that lady
might have held aloof from the rustic bride, simply
from inexperience in life, and not knowing just how
to approach her. But the Judge, who might have been
talking politics or real estate with the young farmer
on the doorsteps that morning, would certainly find it
easier to deal with him as a man and a brother at the
dinner-table. From these different causes women get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the credit or discredit of being more aristocratic than
men are; so that in England the Tory supporters of
female suffrage base it on the ground that these new
voters at least will be conservative.</p>

<p class='c014'>But, on the other hand, it is women, even more
than men, who are attracted by those strong qualities
of personal character which are always the antidote
to aristocracy. No bold revolutionist ever defied the
established conventionalisms of his times without drawing
his strongest support from women. Poet and novelist
love to depict the princess as won by the outlaw,
the gypsy, the peasant. Women have a way of turning
from the insipidities and proprieties of life to the wooer
who has the stronger hand; from the silken Darnley to
the rude Bothwell. This impulse is the natural corrective
to the aristocratic instincts of womanhood; and
though men feel it less, it is still, even among them,
one of the supports of republican institutions. We need
to keep always balanced between the two influences of
refined culture and of native force. The patrician class,
wherever there is one, is pretty sure to be the more
refined; the plebeian class, the more energetic. That
woman is able to appreciate both elements, is proof
that she is quite capable of doing her share in social
and political life. This English clergyman’s wife, who
devotes her soul to the trimmings and gored skirts of
the lower orders, is no more entitled to represent her
sex than are those ladies who give their whole attention
to the “novel and intricate bonnets” advertised this
season on Broadway.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XLVII.<br /> <span class='large'>MRS. BLANK’S DAUGHTERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Blank, of Far West—let us not draw her from
the “sacred privacy of woman” by giving the name or
place too precisely—has an insurmountable objection
to woman’s voting. So the newspapers say; and this
objection is, that she does not wish her daughters to
encounter disreputable characters at the polls.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a laudable desire, to keep one’s daughters from
the slightest contact with such persons. But how does
Mrs. Blank precisely mean to accomplish this? Will
she shut up the maidens in a harem? When they go
out, will she send messengers through the streets to
bid people hide their faces, as when an Oriental queen
is passing? Will she send them travelling on camels,
veiled by <em>yashmaks</em>? Will she prohibit them from
being so much as seen by a man, except when a physician
must be called for their ailments, and Miss
Blank puts her arm through a curtain, in order that he
may feel her pulse and know no more?</p>

<p class='c014'>Who is Mrs. Blank, and how does she bring up her
daughters? Does she send them to the post-office? If
so, they may wait a half-hour at a time for the mail to
open, and be elbowed by the most disreputable characters,
waiting at their side. If it does the young ladies
no harm to encounter this for the sake of getting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>letters out, will it harm them to do it in order to get
their ballots in? If they go to hear Gough lecture,
they may be kept half an hour at the door, elbowed by
saint and sinner indiscriminately. If it is worth going
through this to hear about temperance, why not to vote
about it? If they go to Washington to the President’s
inauguration, they may stand two hours with Mary
Magdalen on one side of them and Judas Iscariot
on the other. If this contact is rendered harmless by
the fact that they are receiving political information,
will it hurt them to stay five minutes longer in order to
act upon the knowledge they have received?</p>

<p class='c014'>This is on the supposition that the household of
Blank are plain, practical women, unversed in the vanities
of the world. If they belong to fashionable circles,
how much harder to keep them wholly clear of disreputable
contact! Should they, for instance, visit Newport,
they may possibly be seen at the Casino, looking
very happy as they revolve rapidly in the arms of
some very disreputable characters; they will be seen
in the surf, attired in the most scanty and clinging
drapery, and kindly aided to preserve their balance by
the devoted attentions of the same companions. Mrs.
Blank, meanwhile, will look complacently on, with the
other matrons: they are not supposed to know the
current reputation of those whom their daughters meet
“in society;” and, so long as there is no actual harm
done, why should they care? Very well; but why,
then, should they care if they encounter those same
disreputable characters when they go to drop a ballot
in the ballot-box? It will be a more guarded and
distant meeting. It is not usual to dance round-dances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>at the ward-room, so far as I know, or to bathe in
clinging drapery at that rather dry and dusty resort.
If such very close intimacies are all right under the
gas-light or at the beach, why should there be poison
in merely passing a disreputable character at the City
Hall?</p>

<p class='c014'>On the whole, the prospects of Mrs. Blank are not
encouraging. Should she consult a physician for her
daughters, he may be secretly or openly disreputable;
should she call in a clergyman, he may, though a
bishop, have carnal rather than spiritual eyes. If Miss
Blank be caught in a shower, she may take refuge
under the umbrella of an undesirable acquaintance;
should she fall on the ice, the woman who helps to
raise her may have sinned. There is not a spot in any
known land where a woman can live in absolute seclusion
from all contact with evil. Should the Misses
Blank even turn Roman Catholics, and take to a convent,
their very confessor may be secretly a scoundrel;
and they may be glad to flee for refuge to the busy,
buying, selling, dancing, voting world outside.</p>

<p class='c014'>No: Mrs. Blank’s prayers for absolute protection will
never be answered, in respect to her daughters. Why
not, then, find a better model for prayer in that made
by Jesus for his disciples: “I pray Thee, not that
Thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that
Thou shouldst keep them from the evil.” A woman
was made for something nobler in the world, Mrs.
Blank, than to be a fragile toy, to be put behind a
glass case, and protected from contact. It is not her
mission to be hidden away from all life’s evil, but
bravely to work that the world may be reformed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Every mishap among American women brings out
renewed suggestions of what maybe called the “European
plan” in the training of young girls,—the
plan, that is, of extreme seclusion and helplessness.
It is usually forgotten, in these suggestions, that not
much protection is really given anywhere to this particular
class as a whole. Everywhere in Europe, the
restrictions are of caste, not of sex. Even in Turkey,
travellers tell us, women of the humbler vocations are
not much secluded. It is not the object of the “European
plan,” in any form, to protect the virtue of
young women, as such, but only of young ladies; and
the protection is pretty effectually limited to that order.
Among the Portuguese, in the island of Fayal, I found
it to be the ambition of each humble family to bring up
one daughter in a sort of ladylike seclusion: she never
went into the street alone, or without a hood which was
equivalent to a veil; she was taught indoor industries
only; she was constantly under the eye of her mother.
But, in order that one daughter might be thus protected,
all the other daughters were allowed to go alone, day
or evening, bare-headed or bare-footed, by the loneliest
mountain-paths, to bring oranges or firewood or whatever
their work may be—heedless of protection. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>safeguard was for a class: the average exposure of
young womanhood was far greater than with us. So in
London, while you rarely see a young lady alone in
the streets, the housemaid is sent on errands at any hour
of the evening with a freedom at which our city domestics
would quite rebel; and one has to stay but a short
time in Paris to see how entirely limited to a class is
the alleged restraint under which young French girls
are said to be kept.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, it is to be remembered that the whole “European
plan,” so far as it is applied on the Continent
of Europe, is a plan based upon utter distrust and
suspicion, not only as to chastity, but as to all other
virtues. It is applied among the higher classes almost
as consistently to boys as to girls. In every school
under church auspices, it is the French theory that boys
are never to be left unwatched for a moment; and it is
as steadily assumed that girls will be untruthful if left
to themselves, as that they will do every other wrong.
This to the Anglo-Saxon race seems very demoralizing.
“Suspicion,” said Sir Philip Sidney, “is the way
to lose that which we fear to lose.” Readers of the
Brontë novels will remember the disgust of the English
pupils and teachers in French schools at the constant
espionage around them; and I have more than once
heard young girls who had been trained at such institutions
say that it was a wonder if they had any truthfulness
left, so invariable was the assumption that it
was the nature of young girls to lie. I cannot imagine
any thing less likely to create upright and noble character,
in man or woman, than the systematic application
of the “European plan.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>And that it produces just the results that might be
feared, the whole tone of European literature proves.
Foreigners, no doubt, do habitual injustice to the morality
of French households; but it is impossible that
fiction can utterly misrepresent the community which
produces and reads it. When one thinks of the utter
lightness of tone with which breaches, both of truth
and chastity, are treated even, in the better class of
French novels and plays, it seems absurd to deny the
correctness of the picture. Besides, it is not merely a
question of plays and novels. Consider, for instance,
the contempt with which Taine treats Thackeray for
representing the mother of Pendennis as suffering agonies
when she thinks that her son has seduced a young
girl, his social inferior. Thackeray is not really considered
a model of elevated tone, as to such matters,
among English writers; but the Frenchman is simply
amazed that the Englishman should describe even the
saintliest of mothers as attaching so much weight to
such a small affair.</p>

<p class='c014'>An able newspaper writer, quoted with apparent approval
by the Boston Daily Advertiser, praises the supposed
foreign method for the “habit of dependence and
deference” that it produces; and because it gives to a
young man a wife whose “habit of deference is established.”
But it must be remembered, that, where this
theory is established, the habit of deference is logically
carried much farther than mere conjugal convenience
would take it. Its natural outcome is the authority of
the priest, not of the husband. That domination of
the women of France by the priesthood which forms
to-day the chief peril of the republic,—which is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>strength of legitimism and imperialism and all other
conspiracies against the liberty of the French people,—is
only the visible and inevitable result of this dangerous
docility.</p>

<p class='c014'>One thing is certain, that the best preparation for
freedom is freedom; and that no young girls are so
poorly prepared for American life as those whose early
years are passed in Europe. The worst imprudences,
the most unmaidenly and offensive actions, that I have
ever heard of in decent society, have been on the part
of young women educated in Europe, who have been
launched into American life without its early training,—have
been treated as children until they suddenly
awakened to the freedom of women. On the other
hand, I remember with pleasure, that a cultivated
French mother, whose daughter’s fine qualities were
the best seal of her motherhood, once told me that the
models she had chosen in her daughter’s training were
certain families of American young ladies, of whom
she had, through peculiar circumstances, seen much in
Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the most amusing letters ever quoted in any

had just learned English. It is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>The first steps in culture do not, then, it seems, remove
from the feminine soul the love of finery. Nor
do the later steps wholly extinguish it; for did not
Grace Greenwood hear the learned Mary Somerville
conferring with the wise Harriet Martineau as to
whether a certain dress should be dyed to match a certain
shawl? Well! why not? Because women learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the use of the quill, are they to ignore “featherses”?
Because they learn science, must they unlearn the arts,
and above all the art of being beautiful? If men
have lost it, they have reason to regret the loss. Let
women hold to it, while yet within their reach.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Rachel Howland of New Bedford, much prized
and trusted as a public speaker among Friends, and a
model of taste and quiet beauty in costume, delighted
the young girls at a Newport Yearly Meeting, a few
years since, by boldly declaring that she thought God
meant women to make the world beautiful, as much as
flowers and butterflies, and that there was no sin in
tasteful dress, but only in devoting to it too much
money or too much time. It is a blessed doctrine.
The utmost extremes of dress, the love of colors, of
fabrics, of jewels, of “featherses,” are, after all, but
an effort after the beautiful. The reason why the
beautiful is not always the result is because so many
women are ignorant or merely imitative. They have
no sense of fitness: the short wear what belongs to
the tall, and brunettes sacrifice their natural beauty to
look like blondes. Or they have no adaptation; and
even an emancipated woman may show a disregard
for appropriateness, as where a fine lady sweeps the
streets, or a fair orator the platform, with a silken or
velvet train which accords only with a carpet as luxurious
as itself. What is inappropriate is never beautiful.
What is merely in the fashion is never beautiful.
But who does not know some woman whose taste and
training are so perfect that fashion becomes to her a
means of grace instead of a despot, and the worst excrescence
that can be prescribed—a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chignon</span></i>, a hoop,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>a panier—is softened into something so becoming that
even the Parisian bondage seems but a chain of roses?</p>

<p class='c014'>In such hands, even “featherses” become a fine
art, not a matter of vanity. Are women so much
more vain than men? No doubt they talk more about
their dress, for there is much more to talk about; yet
did you never hear the men of fashion discuss boots
and hats and the liveries of grooms? A good friend
of mine, a shoemaker, who supplies very high heels
for a great many pretty feet on Fifth Avenue in New
York, declares that women are not so vain of their feet
as men. “A man who thinks he has a handsome foot,”
quoth our fashionable Crispin, “is apt to give us more
trouble than any lady among our customers. I have
noticed this for twenty years.” The testimony is consoling—to
women.</p>

<p class='c014'>And this naturally suggests the question, What is to
be the future of masculine costume? Is the present
formlessness and gracelessness and monotony of hue
to last forever, as suited to the rough needs of a work-a-day
world? It is to be remembered that the difference
in this respect between the dress of the sexes is a
very recent thing. Till within a century or so men
dressed as picturesquely as women, and paid as minute
attention to their costume. Even the fashions in armor
varied as extensively as the fashions in gowns. One
of Henry III.’s courtiers, Sir J. Arundel, had fifty-two
complete suits of cloth of gold. No satin, no velvet,
was too elegant for those who sat to Copley for their
pictures. In Puritan days the laws could hardly be
made severe enough to prevent men from wearing silver-lace
and “broad bone-lace,” and shoulder-bands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>undue width, and double ruffs and “immoderate great
breeches.” What seemed to the Cavaliers the extreme
of stupid sobriety in dress, would pass now for the most
fantastic array. Fancy Samuel Pepys going to a wedding
of to-day in his “new colored silk suit and coat
trimmed with gold buttons, and gold broad lace round
his hands, very rich and fine.” It would give to the
ceremony the aspect of a fancy ball; yet how much
prettier a sight is a fancy ball than the ordinary entertainment
of the period!</p>

<p class='c014'>Within the last few years the rigor of masculine costume
is a little relaxed; velvets are resuming their picturesque
sway: and, instead of the customary suit of
solemn black, gentlemen are appearing in blue and
gold editions at evening parties. Let us hope that
good sense and taste may yet meet each other, for
both sexes; that men may borrow for their dress some
womanly taste, women some masculine sense; and
society may again witness a graceful and appropriate
costume, without being too much absorbed in “featherses.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>L.<br /> <span class='large'>SOME MAN-MILLINERY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We may breathe more freely. The religious prospects
of America brighten. Our dealers have received
the “Catalogue of Clerical Vestments and Improved
Church Ornaments manufactured by Simon Jeune, 34
Rue de Cléry, Paris.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Why are we not a nation of saints? Plainly, because
the church-apparatus has hitherto been so very
deficient. Religion has been, so to speak, naked. The
dry-goods stores, supplying only the laity, have left the
clergy unclothed. In what ready-made-clothing store
can you find any thing like a proper alb? Ask your
tailor, if you dare, for a chasuble. At Stewart’s shop
New Yorkers boast that you can buy any thing; but
fancy a respectable citizen entering those marble portals,
and demanding a cope or a dalmatic! As for
an ombrellino, or an antependium, you might as well
attempt to go buffalo-hunting in Broadway. In that
case you would at least find the dried skin of the animal;
but we doubt if there is to be found on sale any
thing nearer an ombrellino than a lady’s parasol. They
order this thing otherwise in France.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Simon Jeune provides every one of these simple
luxuries. Not a device by which a rich man may enter
the kingdom of heaven, but he has it at his fingers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>ends. None of your cheap salvations mar the dignity
of 34 Rue de Cléry. “We do not manufacture these
articles at a low price,” he calmly announces. There
is no limit in the other direction. You can lead souls
to heaven in a robe worth twenty-five guineas; but, if
you insist on parsimony in your piety, you must patronize
some other establishment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet who that reads this catalogue, and revels for a
half-hour amid its gold and jewels, would care to be
parsimonious? What is money worth, except as a
means of putting one’s favorite minister into a chasuble
“in gold cloth with glazed friz ground, double superior
quality”? Since the Christian must at any rate bear
his cross, is it not a satisfaction to have it “on a gold
ground, richly worked in gold and silver”? If there
is no true religion without a cope, is it not well that its
“hood and orfraies” should be “surrounded with
glazed gold-columned galloon”? And, as death must
come at any rate, is it not something that your pall may
bear “a handsome design of silver tears in emboss in
the centre of the cross,” price only six guineas?</p>

<p class='c014'>Time would fail to tell of the banners and the dais, the
altar-cloths and frontals, the pastoral stoles and benediction-scarfs,
the pyxes and chalices, and, in short, all
dear delights of consecrated souls. This saintly upholsterer
makes as many “fresh sacrifices,” it would appear,
as any other retailer; but, as this does not prevent
him from pricing a dais as high as four hundred
pounds sterling, there is no danger of the purchasers
finding any thing cheap enough to be really discreditable.
And the goods are all warranted to be as indestructible
as the lowly virtues they symbolize.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>M. Jeune positively announces that he “supplies
every article connected with the Roman Catholic
Church.” Perhaps he reserves the faith, hope, and
charity for the next catalogue, as they do not appear
largely in this. In other respects, reading this catalogue
is as good as a seat in the most fashionable church,
and leaves much the same impression. It is especially
useful for summer-time, when one may wander in the
country, to the peril of one’s soul, and may consider
the lilies a great deal too much, and may come to
thinking religion a thing obtainable on cheap terms,
after all. This would not do for M. Jeune’s business:
let us return to the realities of time and eternity, and
consider this “embroidered glory of spangles and prul,”—whatever
prul may be.</p>

<p class='c014'>But can it, after all, be possible that these gorgeous
garments are to be worn by men only, and that those
same men will sometimes treat it as a reproach to
women that they are fond of dress?</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LI.<br /> <span class='large'>SUBLIME PRINCES IN DISTRESS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In looking over some miscellaneous papers which
came, the other day, into my hands, I found among
them a newspaper scrap, expressing certain criticisms
familiar to the inquiring mind. It stated the predominant
attribute of women to be frivolity; an inordinate
love of show, display, rank, title, dress; a habit of absorption
in the petty details of these follies, to the exclusion
of all serious thought and purpose. In reading
this lucubration, one was led to suppose that the whole
aim of all women was to meet in little circles where
they could wear costly attire, call themselves by fine
names, and, in the concise Italian phrase, “peacock
themselves” generally.</p>

<p class='c014'>But there happened to be among the same papers
another class of documents which tended to unsettle
the mind a little on these topics. These documents
were in print, and were not marked as private, or
addressed to any particular name, so that there can be
no harm in reprinting one of them, suppressing, however,
all reference to particular persons or places, lest I
should be innocently betraying some awful secret. The
paper affording most information was as follows, the
dashes of omission (——) being mine, but all the rest
being given <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</span></i>:—</p>

in full at this Rendezvous.” And it appears that this
work must have something of a military character; for
it seems from another circular, which I will not quote
in full, that the purpose of the rendezvous can be much
better carried out if the members will provide themselves
with a costly uniform, including a sword and other
equipments. Yet it would also appear that the expenses
of this organization, apart from the uniform, are so
great as to call forth the following notice:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>Delinquents.</span>—The Finance Committee recommend the
discharge from Membership of the following Sublime Princes,
for non-payment of dues, they having failed to make any satisfactory
reply to repealed notices of their indebtedness.” [Then
follows a list of names and amounts varying from $17 to $23.]</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>One of the most brilliant of recent French novels,
Daudet’s “Les Rois en Exil,” lays its whole plot among
the forlorn class of dethroned sovereigns in Paris; but
really their sorrows do not touch an American heart
so deeply as this black-list. Here are nearly twenty
Princes on our own soil who are publicly exposed in a
single circular as refusing, after “repeated notices of
their indebtedness,” even to reply satisfactorily. What
pleasure can there be in the most attractive “rendezvous,”
what joy in the most absorbing “work,” when
one thinks of all these fallen Sublime Princes wandering,
like Milton’s angels, into outer darkness? I almost
blush to own that I recognize among the names of these
outcasts one or two acquaintances of my own, who
certainly passed for honest men before they became
princes.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the most interesting question for women to consider
is this: Who conducts this picturesque consistory,
with its rites, its titles, and its uniforms? Which sex
is it that makes up this society, and twenty other
societies so absorbing in their “work” that some worthy
persons have a “society” for almost every evening
in the week? Is it the sex which is alleged to be frivolous,
dressy, and eager for rank and title? Or is it the
grave sex, the serious and hard-working sex, the “noble
sex,” <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sexe noble</span></i>, as some of the French grammars
call it? No doubt there is under all this display and
formality, in this “consistory,” as in most similar organizations,
a great deal of mutual help and friendliness.
But so there is under even the seeming frivolities
of women: the majority of fashionable women
have good hearts, and do good. If substantial and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>practical men like to cover even their benevolent organizations
with something of show and display, and to
“peacock themselves” a little, why should not women
be permitted the same privilege? Surely Sublime
Princes should stand by their order, and not look with
disdain on those who would like to be Sublime Princesses
if they only could.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LII.<br /> <span class='large'>“EXPERIMENTS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Why is it, that, whenever any thing is done for women
in the way of education, it is called “an experiment,”—something
that is to be long considered, stoutly opposed,
grudgingly yielded, and dubiously watched,—while,
if the same thing is done for men, its desirableness
is assumed as a matter of course, and the thing is
done? Thus, when Harvard College was founded, it
was not regarded as an experiment, but as an institution.
The “General Court,” in 1636, “agreed to
give 400<em>l.</em> towards a schoale or colledge,” and the
affair was settled. Every subsequent step in the expanding
of educational opportunities for young men
has gone in the same way. But when there seems a
chance of extending, however irregularly, some of the
same collegiate advantages to women, I observe that
the Boston Daily Advertiser and the Atlantic Monthly,
in all good faith, speak of the measure as an “experiment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems to me no more of an “experiment” than
when a boy who has hitherto eaten up his whole apple
becomes a little touched with a sense of justice, and
finally decides to offer his sister the smaller half. If
he has ever regarded that offer as an experiment,
the first actual trial will put the result into the list of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>certainties; and it will become an axiom in his mind
that girls like apples. Whatever may be said about the
position of women in law and society, it is clear that
their educational disadvantages have been a prolonged
disgrace to the other sex, and one for which women
themselves are in no way accountable. When Françoise
de Saintonges, in the sixteenth century, wished
to establish girls’ schools in France, she was hooted in
the streets, and her father called together four doctors
of law to decide whether she was possessed of a devil
in planning to teach women,—”<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour s’assurer qu’instruire
des femmes n’était pas un œuvre du démon</span></i>.”
From that day to this, we have seen women almost
always more ready to be taught than was any one else
to teach them. Talk as you please about their wishing
or not wishing to vote: they have certainly wished for
instruction, and have had it doled out to them almost
as grudgingly as if it were the ballot itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Consider the educational history of Massachusetts,
for instance. The wife of President John Adams was
born in 1744; and she says of her youth that “female
education, in the best families, went no farther than
writing and arithmetic.” Barry tells us in his History
of Massachusetts, that the public education was first
provided for boys only; “but light soon broke in, and
girls were allowed to attend the public schools two
hours a day.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> It appears from President Quincy’s
“Municipal History of Boston,”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that from 1790 girls
were there admitted to such schools, but during the
summer months only, when there were not boys enough
to fill them,—from April 20 to Oct. 20 of each year.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>This lasted until 1822, when Boston became a city.
Four years after, an attempt was made to establish
a high school for girls, which was not, however, to
teach Latin and Greek. It had, in the words of the
school committee of 1854, “an alarming success;”
and the school was abolished after eighteen months’
trial, because the girls crowded into it; and as Mr.
Quincy, with exquisite simplicity, records, “not one
voluntarily quitted it, and there was no reason to
suppose that any one admitted to the school would
voluntarily quit for the whole three years, except in
case of marriage!”</p>

<p class='c014'>How amusing seems it now to read of such an
“experiment” as this, abandoned only because of
its overwhelming success! How absurd now seem the
discussions of a few years ago!—the doubts whether
young women really desired higher education, whether
they were capable of it, whether their health would
bear it, whether their parents would permit it. The
address I gave before the Social Science Association
on this subject, at Boston, May 14, 1873, now seems
to me such a collection of platitudes that I hardly see
how I dared come before an intelligent audience with
such needless reasonings. It is as if I had soberly
labored to prove that two and two make four, or that
ginger is “hot i’ the mouth.” Yet the subsequent
discussion in that meeting showed that around even
these harmless and commonplace propositions the battle
of debate could rage hot; and it really seemed as if
even to teach women the alphabet ought still to be mentioned
as “a promising experiment.” Now, with the
successes before us of Vassar and Wellesley and Smith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Colleges, of Michigan and Cornell and Boston Universities;
with the spectacle at Cambridge of young women
actually reading Plato “at sight” with Professor Goodwin,—it
surely seems as if the higher education of
women might be considered quite beyond the stage
of experiment, and might henceforth be provided for
in the same common-sense and matter-of-course way
which we provide for the education of young men.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, if this point is already reached in education,
how long before it will also be reached in political life,
and women’s voting be viewed as a matter of course,
and a thing no longer experimental?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LIII.<br /> <span class='large'>INTELLECTUAL CINDERELLAS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When, some thirty years ago, the extraordinary
young mathematician, Truman Henry Safford, first
attracted the attention of New England by his rare
powers, I well remember the pains that were taken to
place him under instruction by the ablest Harvard professors:
the greater his abilities, the more needful that
he should have careful and symmetrical training. The
men of science did not say, “Stand off! let him alone!
let him strive patiently until he has achieved something
positively valuable, and he may be sure of prompt and
generous recognition—when he is fifty years old.” If
such a course would have been mistaken and ungenerous
if applied to Professor Safford, why is it not something
to be regretted that it was applied to Mrs. Somerville?
In her case, the mischief was done: she was, happily,
strong enough to bear it; but, as the English critics
say, we never shall know what science has lost by it.
We can do nothing for her now; but we could do something
for future women like her, by pointing this obvious
moral for their benefit, instead of being content
with a mere tardy recognition of success, after a woman
has expended half a century in struggle.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is commonly considered to be a step forward in
civilization, that whereas ancient and barbarous nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>exposed children to special hardships, in order to kill
off the weak and toughen the strong, modern nations
aim to rear all alike carefully, without either sacrificing
or enfeebling. If we apply this to muscle, why not to
mind? and, if to men’s minds, why not to women’s?
Why use for men’s intellects, which are claimed to be
stronger, the forcing process,—offering, for instance,
many thousand dollars a year in gratuities at Harvard
College, that young men may be induced to come and
learn,—and only withhold assistance from the weaker
minds of women? A little schoolgirl once told me that
she did not object to her teacher’s showing partiality,
but thought she “ought to show partiality to all alike.”
If all our university systems are wrong, and the proper
diet for mathematical genius consists of fifty years’
snubbing, let us employ it, by all means; but let it be
applied to both sexes.</p>

<p class='c014'>That it is the duty of women, even under disadvantageous
circumstances, to prove their purpose by labor,
to “verify their credentials,” is true enough; but this
moral is only part of the moral of Mrs. Somerville’s
book, and is cruelly incomplete without the other half.
What a garden of roses was Mrs. Somerville’s life,
according to some comfortable critics! “All that for
which too many women nowadays are content to sit
and whine, or fitfully and carelessly struggle, came
naturally and quietly to Mrs. Somerville. And the
reason was, that she never asked for any thing until
she had earned it; or, rather, she never asked at all,
but was content to earn.” Naturally and quietly!
You might as well say that Garrison fought slavery
“quietly,” or that Frederick Douglass’s escape came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>him “naturally.” Turn to the book itself, and see
with what strong, though never bitter, feeling, the author
looks back upon her hard struggle.</p>

<p class='c021'>“I was intensely ambitious to excel in something; for I felt
in my own breast that women were capable of taking a higher
place in creation than that assigned them in my early days,
which was very low” (p. <a href='#Page_60'>60</a>). “Nor&nbsp;... should I have had
courage to ask any of them a question, for I should have been
laughed at. I was often very sad and forlorn; not a hand held
out to help me” (p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>). “My father came home for a short
time, and, somehow or other finding out what I was about,
said to my mother, ‘Peg, we must put a stop to this, or we shall
have Mary in a strait-jacket one of these days’” (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>). “I
continued my mathematical and other pursuits, but under
great disadvantages; for, although my husband did not prevent
me from studying, I met with no sympathy whatever from
him, as he had a very low opinion of the capacity of my sex,
and had neither knowledge of nor interest in science of any
kind” (p. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>). “I was considered eccentric and foolish; and
my conduct was highly disapproved of by many, especially by
some members of my own family” (p. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>). “A man can always
command his time under the plea of business: a woman
is not allowed any such excuse” (p. <a href='#Page_164'>164</a>). And so on.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last in 1831—Mrs. Somerville being then fifty-one—her
work on “The Mechanism of the Heavens”
appeared. Then came universal recognition, generous
if not prompt, a tardy acknowledgment. “Our relations,”
she says, “and others who had so severely
criticised and ridiculed me, astonished at my success,
were now loud in my praise.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a> No doubt. So were,
probably, Cinderella’s sisters loud in her praise, when
the prince at last took her from the chimney-corner,
and married her. They had kept for themselves, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>sure, as long as they could, the delights and opportunities
of life; while she had taken the place assigned her
in her early days,—“which was very low,” as Mrs.
Somerville says. But, for all that, they were very kind
to her in the days of her prosperity; and no doubt
packed their little trunks, and came to visit their dear
sister at the palace, as often as she could wish. And,
doubtless, the Fairyland Monthly of that day, when it
came to review Cinderella’s “Personal Recollections,”
pointed out, that, as soon as that distinguished lady had
“achieved something positively valuable,” she received
“prompt and generous recognition.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LIV.<br /> <span class='large'>FOREIGN EDUCATION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is a fashionable phrase which always awakens
my inward protest,—“the advantages of foreign education.”
Every summer brings within my view a large
class of people who have perhaps spent their youth in
Europe, and then have taken Europe for their wedding-tour;
and then, after a year or two at home, have found
it an excellent reason for going abroad again “to give
the children the advantage of foreign education, you
know.” And, as it is in regard to girls that this advantage
is especially claimed, it is in respect to them
that I wish to speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>In some ways, undoubtedly, the early foreign training
offers an advantage. It is a thing of very great
convenience to have the easy colloquial command of
one or two languages beside one’s own; and this can
no doubt be obtained far more readily by a few years of
early life abroad than by any method employed in later
years at home. There are also some unquestionable
advantages in respect to music, art, and European
geography and history. The trouble is, that, when we
have enumerated these advantages, we have mentioned
all.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, as a further trouble, it comes about that these
things, being all that are better learned in Europe, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>easily assumed, by what may be called our Europeanized
classes, to be all that are worth learning, especially
for girls. When, in such circles, you hear of
a young lady as “splendidly educated,” it commonly
turns out that she speaks several languages admirably,
and plays well on the piano, or sketches well. It is
not needful for such an indorsement that she should
have the slightest knowledge of mathematics, of logic,
of rhetoric, of metaphysics, of political economy, of
physiology, of any branch of natural science, or of any
language, or literature, or history, except those of
modern Europe. All these missing branches she would
have been far more likely to study, if she had never
been abroad: all these, or a sufficient number of them,
she would have been pretty sure to study at a first-class
American “academy” or high school. But all these
she is almost sure to have missed in Europe,—missed
them so thoroughly, indeed, that she is likely to regard
with suspicion any one who knows any thing about
them, as being “awfully learned.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet it needs no argument to show that the studies
thus omitted by girls taught in Europe are the studies
which train the intellect. That a girl should know her
own powers of body and mind, should know how to
observe, how to combine, how to think; that she should
know the history and literature of the world at large,
and in particular of the country in which she is to live,—this
is certainly more important than that she should
be able to speak two or three languages as well as a
European courier, and should have nothing to say in
any of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>A very few persons I have known who contrived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>while living abroad, to keep a home atmosphere round
their children, and who, by great personal effort, succeeded
in giving to their girls that solid early training
which is to be had in every high school in this country,
but is only to be obtained by personal effort, and under
great disadvantages, in Europe. Wiser still, in my
judgment, were those who trusted America for the
main training, but contrived early to secure for their
children the needful year or two of foreign life, for
the learning of languages alone. Perhaps we exaggerate,
too, the absolute necessity of foreign study, even
for modern languages. The Russians, who are the best
linguists in Europe, are not in the habit of expatriating
themselves for that purpose; and perhaps we have
something to learn from them in this direction, as well
as in the line of Professor Runkle’s machine-shops.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LV.<br /> <span class='large'>TEACHING THE TEACHERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Cotton Mather says of his father, Increase Mather,
that, when he became president of Harvard College, it
was from the desire to teach those who were to teach
others, or, as he expresses it, not to shape the building
but the builders,—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non lapides dolare sed architectos</span></i>. It
is curious to see that women are admitted more readily
to this higher work than to the lower. Thus I know
a lady who teaches elocution professionally, and has
clerical pupils among others. One of these assures
me that he finds his power and influence in the pulpit
much increased through her instruction. Yet there is
scarcely a denomination which would admit her into the
pulpit: she can direct the builders, but can take no
share in the building.</p>

<p class='c014'>It sometimes occurred to me, when a member of the
legislature of Massachusetts, that the little I knew of
political economy was mainly due to the assiduous reading,
in childhood, of Miss Martineau’s stories founded
on that science. Yet it would have been thought something
very astounding, were some such woman to have
a seat in that legislature. So I have seen classes of
young men and maidens, in a high school, reciting
political economy out of Mrs. Fawcett’s excellent textbook,—and
sometimes reciting it to a woman; and yet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>should any one of these boys ever become a member of
“the Great and General Court,” as the legislature is
called in Massachusetts, he could not even invite this
teacher, or Mrs. Fawcett herself, to sit beside him and
aid him with her advice. Can any one help seeing that
this distinction is a merely traditional thing, and one
that cannot last?</p>

<p class='c014'>At the last teachers’ convention which I attended, I
heard a lady, Mrs. Knox, give an address on the best
way of teaching English composition. There was
assembled a great body of teachers, some five or six
hundred; the church was crowded; and yet this lady
faced the audience for some three-quarters of an hour,—she
being armed only with a piece of chalk and a
blackboard,—and held it in close attention. Without
perceptible effort, and without a word or an attitude
that was otherwise than womanly and graceful, she
taught the teachers, men and women alike. I do not
see how it is possible that the alleged supremacy of
man can long withstand such influences.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems very appropriate to read from town after
town, in reference to the late school elections, “The
first lady to deposit her ballot was Miss ——, a teacher
in the high school.” Who else should be first? I do
not think that men generally comprehend how absurd
it is to an experienced teacher, who has for years been
putting into the brains of dull boys all the activity they
possess, to see those boys grow up to be men and voters,
and decide what to do with the money she pays in
taxes, while she is set aside as “only a woman.”
Her pupils cannot make a speech in town-meeting,
they cannot present a report on any subject, they cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>show any capacity of leadership, without exhibiting
the influence she has had over them. Yet they are now
as entirely beyond her direct reach as if she were a hen
who had hatched ducklings, and had lived to see them
swimming away. But the teachers are worse off than
the hens; because they have actually taught their ducklings
to swim, and could swim themselves if permitted.
After all, Horace Mann builded better than he knew.
Every step in the training of women as teachers implies
a farther step.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LVI.<br /> <span class='large'>“CUPID-AND-PSYCHOLOGY.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The learned Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
England, is frequently facetious; and his jokes are
quoted with the deference due to the chief officer of
the chief college of that great university. Now, it is
known that the Cambridge colleges, and Trinity College
in particular, are doing a great deal for the instruction
of women. The young women of Girton
College and Newnham College,—both of these being
institutions for women, in or near Cambridge,—not
only enjoy the instruction of the university, but they
share it under a guaranty that it shall be of the best
quality; because they attend, in many cases, the very
same lectures with the young men. Where this is not
done, they sometimes use the vacant lecture-rooms of
the college; and it was in connection with an application
for this privilege that the Master of Trinity College
made his last joke,—the last, at any rate, that has
crossed the Atlantic. When told that the lecture-room
was needed for a class of young women in psychology,
he said, “Psychology? What kind of psychology?
Cupid-and-Psychology, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cupid-and-Psychology is, after all, not so bad a
department of instruction. It may be taken as a good
enough symbol of that mingling of head and heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>which is the best result of all training. One of the
worst evils of the separate education of the sexes has
been the easy assumption that men were to be made all
head, and women all heart. It was to correct the evils
of this, that Ben Jonson proposed for his ideal woman</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“a learned and a manly soul.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It was an implied recognition of it from the other side
when the great masculine intellect, Goethe, held up as
a guiding force in his Faust “the eternal womanly”
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">das ewige weibliche</span></i>). After all, each sex must teach
the other, and impart to the other. It will never do to
have all the brains poured into one human being, and
christened “man;” and all the affections decanted
into another, and labelled “woman.” Nature herself
rejects this theory. Darwin himself, the interpreter of
nature, shows that there is a perpetual effort going on,
by unseen forces, to equalize the sexes, since sons
often inherit from the mother, and daughters from the
father. And we all take pleasure in discovering in
the noblest of each sex something of the qualities of
the other,—the tender affections in great men, the imperial
intellect in great women.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the whole, there is no harm, but rather good, in
the new science of Cupid-and-Psychology. There are
combinations for which no single word can suffice. The
phrase belongs to the same class with Lowell’s witty
denunciation of a certain tiresome letter-writer, as
being, not his incubus, but his “pen-and-inkubus.” It
is as well to admit it first as last: Cupid-and-Psychology
will be taught wherever young men and women study
together. Not in the direct and simple form of mutual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>love-making, perhaps; for they tell the visitor, at universities
which admit both sexes, that the young men
and maidens do not fall in love with each other, but
are apt to seek their mates elsewhere. The new science
has a wider bearing, and suggests that the brain is incomplete,
after all, without the affections; and so are
the affections without the brain. The very professorship
at Harvard University which Rev. Dr. Peabody is
just leaving, and which Rev. Phillips Brooks has been
invited to fill, was founded by a woman, Miss Plummer;
and the name proposed by her for it was “a professorship
of the heart,” though they after all called it
only a professorship of “Christian morals.” We need
the heart in our colleges, it seems, even if we only get
it under the ingenious title of Cupid-and-Psychology.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LVII.<br /> <span class='large'>MEDICAL SCIENCE FOR WOMEN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In reading, the other day, a speech on the Medical
Education of Women, it struck me that the most important
reason for this education was one which the
speaker had not mentioned,—the fact that the medical
profession stands for science; and that women peculiarly
need science, since their natural bent is supposed to be
a little the other way. The other professions represent
tradition very generally: the lawyer must be bound by
precedents; the clergyman generally admits that he
must go back to his texts. But the physician claims,
at least, to be a man of science, and stands for that
before the world. Hence the sacredness with which
his position has always been surrounded. The Florida
Indians, according to the early voyagers, not only took
the physician’s medicine, but they took the physician
himself internally, after his death. All other men were
buried; but the body of the physician was burned, and
his ashes mixed with water, by way of a permanent
prescription.</p>

<p class='c014'>At any rate, the physician himself popularly stands
for science; and, in this point of view, his position is
very noble. I have known physicians whose professed
materialism was more elevated than most of what the
world calls religion. To trace that wondrous power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>called life, which takes these particles of matter, and
makes them think with thought, or glow with passion,
or put forth an activity so intense as to be the parent
of new life from generation to generation,—this study
is something sublime. He who reverently ponders on
this may call himself theist or atheist, he is yet worthy
to be revered: if he can teach us, he blesses us. “I
touch heaven,” said Novalis, “when I lay my hand on
a human body;” and the popularity among physicians
of that fine engraving of Vesalius standing ready for
his first dissection, shows that they take a higher view
of their vocation than the world sometimes admits.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seems to me peculiarly important that women
should have a share in these studies. They often have
time enough. It takes more time for a woman to make
herself charming than to make herself learned, Sydney
Smith says; and he thinks it a pity that she should
often hang up her brains on the wall in poor pictures,
or waft them into the air in poor music, when they
might be better employed. Yet a great physician, Dr.
Currie, says in his letters that he always preferred to
have an ignorant patient bring his wife with him, because
he could always get more careful observation and
quicker suggestions from the woman. This point lies
directly in the line of medical education.</p>

<p class='c014'>The study lies also directly in their path as prospective
wives and mothers, and this alone would furnish a
sufficient reason for it. A woman of superior gifts,
who had studied medicine, but never adopted it as a
profession, told me that the mere domestic use of her
knowledge had more than repaid her for all the trouble
it had cost. For a man who should thus abandon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>pursuit, it would be of comparatively little service, apart
from the general training; but for a woman, if she fulfills
the commoner duties of a woman’s life, this early
knowledge will always be a source of direct strength.
This applies in a degree to surgery also; and I have
always wondered, in view of the old proverb that a
surgeon should have “a lion’s heart and a lady’s
hand,” why our professors do not oftener aim at developing
this heart, if need be, in those who have the
hand without training.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>SEWING IN SCHOOLS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mr. N. T. Allen, of West Newton, Mass., who has
had much experience and success as a teacher of both
sexes, has been visiting the German public schools.
He has lately given an interesting report of his observations
to the Middlesex County Teachers’ Association.
The reporter says (the Italics being my own),—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Mr. Allen paid particular attention to the Dorf Schule of
the cities, and the Bürger Schule of the country, both being of
the lower grades; and contended that the educational system
of Germany was far from being perfect, and was inferior in
certain respects to that adopted in some of our own States,
and carried into successful operation in several towns and
communities. It was compulsory and autocratic, in that parents
were not allowed any choice in the education of their
children; <em>it was unjust toward girls, in establishing and perpetuating
the idea of their great mental inferiority to the boys</em>; it
was undemocratic, in having different schools for different
castes and classes of society; and it was extremely sectarian
and bigoted in the religious dogmatic instruction prescribed
and forced upon all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is well known that in the German schools a certain
number of hours are given by the girls to sewing, and
that their course of study, as compared with that of the
boys, is narrowed to make room for this. It is for this
reason that I, for one, dread to see sewing brought into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>our public schools. So strong is still the disposition in
many minds to put off girls with less schooling than
boys, that it seems unsafe to provide so good an excuse
for this inequality.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole theory of industrial schools is liable to a
similar danger,—that of introducing class distinctions
into our education. It tends toward that other evil of
the German system, described by Mr. Allen, “having
different schools for different castes in society.” I
hold to the old theory of providing all boys and girls,
whatever their parentage or probable pursuit, with a
good basis of common-school education, and then trusting
the intellectual faculties, thus sharpened, to help
them in the struggle for life. Just as it was found in
the army that a well-educated young man who had
never handled a musket soon overtook and passed a
comrade of inferior brains who had been in the militia
from boyhood, so is it found to be with those whose
minds have been well taught in our public schools. But
whether this criticism holds, or not, against industrial
schools, as such, it certainly holds when we further
make an industrial discrimination against all girls.
This we do, if we take an hour of their time for sewing,
when the boys give that hour to study.</p>

<p class='c014'>But it will be said, Ought not girls to be taught to
sew? Undoubtedly. All boys ought to be taught the
use of hammer and plane and screw-driver, and, for
that matter, plain sewing also. Girls need sewing
no doubt; and they should be taught it at home, or
at school, or wherever they can find a teacher. But,
for all this, to assign to sewing any thing like the
same relative importance that belonged to it a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>years ago, or even twenty years ago, is to overlook the
changed conditions of modern society. Let us consider
this a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Old-World theory was that all imaginable hard
work was to be done by human hands. But the New-World
theory is—for it is a New World wherever the
theory is recognized—that all this work should be
done, as far as possible, by human brains. Napoleon
defined it as his ultimate intention for the French
people, “to convert all trades into arts,” the head
doing the work of the hands. This applies to woman’s
work as much as any other. The epoch of private
spinning and weaving was an epoch of barbarism; the
vast mills of Lowell and Fall River now do that toil.
The sewing-machine does a day’s work in an hour.
But all this machinery came out of somebody’s brain,
and is adapted to a race of women with brains. The
treasurer of half a dozen manufacturing corporations
told me last week, that, though the mills were filled
with French and Irish, the superiority of American
“help” was just as manifest as ever, and the manufacturers
would gladly keep them if they could: they
could almost always tend more looms, for instance.
Those who have tried to teach the use of the sewing-machine
to the Southern negroes or poor whites know
how hard it is. A sewing-machine is a step in civilization:
its presence in a house, like that of a piano,
proves a certain stage of advancement. Its course
runs parallel with that of the common-school; and an
agent for this machine, like those who sell improved
agricultural implements, would instinctively avoid those
regions where there are no schoolhouses.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>I do not undervalue the use of the hands, or the
need of physical training for both boys and girls. But,
after all, the hands must be kept subordinate to the
head. If industrial training is to be the first thing,
then every Irish parent who takes his ten-year-old girl
from school, and sends her to the factory, is in the
path of virtue. If, on the other hand, it be found that
some time can be advantageously taken from books,
and given to some handiwork, without loss of intellectual
progress, that is a different thing. That is only
an intellectual eight-hour bill or five-hour bill; and, for
one, I should gladly favor that. But let it be done as
securing the best education for all; not as a class-education,
or as merely utilitarian: and let it be done
as rigidly for boys as for girls. Let us not set out with
the theory that a boy may avail himself of all the divisions
of labor in modern society, but that every girl
must still spin her own cloth, and sew her own seam.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LIX.<br /> <span class='large'>CASH PREMIUMS FOR STUDY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On looking over the Harvard College catalogue, I
am struck with the great pecuniary inducements which
are held out to tempt young gentlemen to study.
There are, to begin with, one hundred and seventeen
“scholarships;” yielding incomes ranging from $40 to
$350 annually, but averaging $225. The total income
of these is $19,635. Then there are “loan” and
“beneficiary” funds, amounting to $4,700 annually,
and given or lent in sums from $25 to $75. Then
there are “monitorships,” yielding $700 per annum;
and various money prizes, amounting to some $1,200.
The whole amount that is or may be paid in cash to
undergraduates every year is more than $25,000, which
may perhaps reach a hundred and fifty young men.
No wonder that the catalogue asserts that “The experience
of the past warrants the statement that good
scholars of high character, but slender means, are seldom
or never obliged to leave college for want of
money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably one-sixth of the eight hundred undergraduates
of Harvard College receive direct pecuniary aid in
studying there; and, as scholarship is an essential in
securing most of this pecuniary aid, it is probable that
half the high scholars in every class are thus directly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>helped. Observe that this is in addition to the general
value of the college endowments to all students, over
and above what they pay for tuition,—an amount lately
estimated by the academical authorities at one thousand
dollars, at least, for every graduate. Apart from all
this, I was told many years ago, by that very acute observer,
the late President James Walker of Harvard
University, that in his opinion one-quarter of the undergraduates
were maintained in college through the
personal self-denial and sacrifices of mothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='c014'>But what a tremendous protective tariff, what an irresistible
“discriminating duty,” is this! While boys
are thus bribed largely, year by year, to come to Cambridge,
and study,—so that the influence of all this
promise of pecuniary aid is felt through every academy
and high school in the land,—we find, on the other
hand, that every girl who wishes to pursue similar
studies is expected to pay at the full market rates for
all she gets, and even then cannot enter Harvard College.
In some of our normal schools her board may
be paid, I believe, on condition that she becomes a
teacher; but I know of no place where she herself is
paid, as young men are paid, merely to come and
study. Ex-Gov. Bullock founded one scholarship at
Amherst, of which the income is to be given by preference
to a woman—when a woman is admitted!
But unfortunately that time has not come. And yet
those who sit by the banks of this golden stream, and
monopolize all its benefits, have a tone of sublime contempt
for those who are not permitted to approach it,
and never can quite forgive the impecunious condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of these outcasts! “Your scholarship is not to be
compared to ours,” they say to women. “Certainly
not,” the women may fairly reply: “we were never
paid salaries that we might become scholars.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The thing that perpetually neutralizes all claims of
chivalry, all professions of justice, all talk of fairness,
as between the sexes, is this class of facts. Woman is
systematically excluded from training, and then told
she must not compete; if admitted to compete, she is
so weighted by artificial disadvantages, that it is hard
for her to win. If her brain is inferior, she should be
helped; if her natural obstacles are greater, all other
hinderances should be the more generously swept away.
Give girls a chance at a high school, they use it, and
they there equal boys in scholarship; in our academies,
in our normal schools, there is no deficiency on their
part. Even in our colleges they ask, as yet, only admittance,
not cash premiums. Only admit them, and
see if they do not hold their own unpaid, with the young
men to whom you pay, collectively, twenty-five thousand
dollars a year to stay there. Only a seat in a recitation-room,
to be paid for at the full price,—is this so
very much for a young girl to ask? Do be at least as
generous as that school committee in a Massachusetts
town which shall be nameless, who said seriously in
their report, speaking of a certain appointment, “As
this place offers neither honor nor profit, we do not see
why it should not be filled by a woman”!</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LX.<br /> <span class='large'>MENTAL HORTICULTURE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There was once a public meeting held, at the request
of some excellent ladies, to consider the question
whether it might be possible for roses and lilies to
grow together in the same garden. Many of the
ladies were quite used to gardening, and had opinions
of their own; but, as it was not proper for them to
open their lips before people, they of course could not
testify. So several respectable gentlemen—clergymen
and professors—were invited to tell them all
about it. Some of these gentlemen had seen a rose,
and some had seen a lily, but it turned out that very
few of them had ever happened to see a garden. Still,
as they were learned men, they could give very valuable
suggestions. One of them explained, that, as roses
and lilies assimilated very different juices from the soil,
they could not possibly grow in the same soil. Another
pointed out, that, as they needed different proportions
of sun and of air, they should have very different
exposures, and therefore must be kept apart.
Another, more daring, suggested, that, as God had put
the two species into the same world, it was quite possible
that they might grow in the same enclosure for a
time, perhaps for about fourteen years, but that, if
they were left longer together, they would certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>blight and destroy each other. All this seemed very
conclusive; and the meeting was about to vote that
roses and lilies should never be allowed to exist in the
same garden, unless with a brick wall twenty feet high
between.</p>

<p class='c014'>But it so happened that a sensible gardener from a
distant State was present, and got up to say a word
before the debate closed. “Bless your souls, my good
people, what are you talking about?” said he. “Roses
and lilies are already growing together by the thousand,
all over the country, and you may as well close your
discussion.” Upon which the meeting broke up in
some confusion: the brick wall was never built; but
the clergyman went back to his study, the professor to
his lecture-room, the physician to his patients, and all
remained in the conviction that the gardener was a good
sort of man, but strangely ignorant of scientific horticulture.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which things are an allegory.” The writer has
been reading the report, in the Boston Daily Advertiser,
of a recent debate on female education.</p>

<p class='c014'>I suppose that those born and bred in New England
can never quite abandon the feeling that this region
should still lead the nation, as it once led, in all educational
matters. For one, I cannot help a slight sense
of mortification, when, in an assemblage of Boston professors,
undertaking to discuss a simple practical matter,
everybody begins in the clouds, ignoring the facts
before everybody’s eyes, and discussing as a question
of theory only, what has long since become a matter
of common practice. The mortification is not diminished
when the common-sense has to be at last imported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>from beyond the borders of New England, in
the shape of a college president from Central New
York. To him alone it seems to have occurred to remind
these dwellers in the clouds that what they persisted
in treating as theory had been a matter of daily
experience in half the large towns in New England for
the last quarter of a century.</p>

<p class='c014'>What is the question at issue? Simply this: New
England is full of normal schools, high schools, and
endowed academies. In the majority of these, pupils
of both sexes, from fourteen to twenty-five or thereabouts,
study together and recite together, living either
at home or in boarding-houses, or in academic dormitories,
as the case may be. This has gone on for
many years, without cavil or scandal. As a general
rule, teachers have testified that they prefer to teach
these mixed schools; at any rate, the fact is certain,
that the sexes, once united in schools of this grade,
are very seldom separated again; while we often hear
of the separate schools as being abandoned, and the
sexes brought together. Certainly the experiment of
joint education has been very extensively tried in all
parts of New England; indeed, for schools of this kind,
in most regions, the association of the sexes is the rule,
their separation the exception. Now, the only remaining
question is: This being the case, will it make any
essential difference if you widen the course of instruction
a little, and call the institution a college?</p>

<p class='c014'>This is really the only problem left to be solved; and
yet on this question, thus limited, not a speaker at the
above—except President White of Cornell University—had
apparently a word to say. Every other speaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>appeared to approach the general theme in as profound
and blissful an ignorance as if he had lived all his life in
Turkey or in France, or in some other country where
no young man had ever recited algebra in the same
room with a young woman since the world began.</p>

the ages of combat. But these defects, too, are cured or
lessened; women have now marvellous ways of winning their

  <h3 class='c004'>LXI.<br /> <span class='large'>“SEXUAL DIFFERENCE OF EMPLOYMENT.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I am at a loss to understand an assertion made by
Rev. Dr. Hedge, at an educational meeting in Boston,
that “the course of civilization hitherto has tended to
develop and confirm sexual difference of employment.”
He adds, according to the report in the Daily Advertiser,
that, “the more civilized the country, the more the
vocations of men and women divide: the more savage
the nation, the more they blend and coincide.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With due respect for Dr. Hedge on many grounds,
and especially as having been the first man to demand
publicly in presence of the Harvard alumni the admission
of women to the university, I must yet express
great surprise at his taking what seems to me so utterly
untenable a position. To me it seems, on the contrary,
that it is the savage period which is remarkable for the
industrial separation of the sexes; and that every
epoch of advancing civilization—as the present—blends
them more and more. The fact would have
seemed to me so plain as hardly to need more than
simply to state it, but for the authority of Dr. Hedge
upon the other side.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we trace society back to savage life, what are the
prevailing employments of the male sex? More and
more exclusively, war and the chase. From these two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>vocations, monopolizing literally the whole active life
of the savage man, the savage woman is almost absolutely
excluded. Precisely at the point where the man’s
sphere leaves off, in each of these pursuits, the woman’s
sphere begins. Among American Indians, the man
takes the captive, the woman tortures him. The man
kills the deer, carries it till within sight of his own village,
and then throws it down, that the squaw may go
out and drag it in. Much that seems cruel and selfish
in Indian life is the result, as Mrs. Jameson long since
pointed out, of this complete separation of functions.
The reason why the Indian woman carries the lodgepoles
and the provisions on the march is that the man’s
limbs may be left free and agile for the far severer labors
of war and of the chase, from which she is excluded.
The reason why she finally brings the deer to the camp
is because he has had the more exhausting labor of
hunting and killing it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Contrast now this absolute “sexual difference of
employment” with the greater and greater blending of
civilized society,—a blending, observe, which proceeds
from both sides, and not from woman only. It is hard
to say which is more remarkable, within the last half-century,—the
way in which women have encroached
on men’s work, or the way in which men have encroached
on women’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many mechanical and commercial pursuits,—as
printing and bookkeeping,—once almost monopolized
by men, you now find a very large number of women.
In some pursuits, as in education, the women have
come to outnumber the men enormously, at least in
America; in others, as telegraphy, they seem likely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>do the same. We constantly hear of new channels
opening. A friend of mine, the other day, just before
addressing an audience on woman suffrage, stepped
into a barber’s shop, and to his great amazement was
shaved by a woman. On inquiry, he learned for the
first time, that a good many of that sex, mostly Germans,
pursued this occupation in New York and elsewhere.
Thus do the vocations of men and women now
“blend and coincide.” On the other hand, the leading
dressmaker of the world is a man; our bonnetshops
are largely conducted by men; the eminent hotel
cooks, whose salaries exceed any paid by Harvard
University, are men; and the lady who goes to rest in
a sleeping-car on our railroads has her pillow smoothed
and her curtains drawn, not by a chambermaid, but by
a chamberman.</p>

<p class='c014'>These are the facts which seem to me, I must say,
quite fatal to Dr. Hedge’s theory. And there is one
thing worth noticing in the very different criticisms
passed on men and on women as to these invasions of
each other’s province. If you call attention to the way
in which men are everywhere taking part in women’s
work, people say approvingly, “To be sure! greater
energy, greater skill! they do even women’s work
better than women themselves can.” But if you point
out, that, on the other hand, women are also doing
men’s work, and in some cases—as in literature and
lecturing—are actually obtaining higher prices than
most men can obtain, the same people shake their
heads disapprovingly, and say, “Unsexed; out of
their sphere!” Now, if we lived in an age of chivalrous
protection of women, it would be a different thing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>but, as we live in an age of political economy, there is
no reason why men alone should have the benefit of its
laws. If practical life is to be regarded as a game of
puss-in-the-corner, I should recommend to each ejected
puss to make for the best corner she finds open, without
much deference to the theories of the sages.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE USE OF ONE’S FEET.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Is it better to stand on one’s own feet, or to depend
on those of other people? We need clear views on that
matter, certainly; and there is not much doubt which
theory will ultimately prevail.</p>

<p class='c014'>For one, I believe the whole theory of a leisure-class,
whether for man or woman, to be a snare and a delusion.
It seems to me that there is one great drawback
that a young American may encounter,—namely, the
possession of an independent property; and that there
is one great piece of good fortune,—to be thrown on
one’s self for support. Of all influences for development
or usefulness, I know of none so great as “the
wholesome stimulus of pecuniary necessity.” Of all
forms of social organization, that seems to me the most
favorable which opens to all most freely the opportunity
of early education, and then calls upon each to exert
himself for his own support.</p>

<p class='c014'>To be sure, it is hardly possible to overrate the value
of cultivated companionship and refined association.
In other countries it may be worth while, for the sake
of these, to be born to wealth: it is so hard to get them
without wealth. But the happiest and best American
households are apt to be found among such as Miss
Alcott, for instance, habitually describes, where there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>plenty of refinement and very little money; where perhaps
there has been wealth in times past, but it has
been lost just in time for the good of the children. All
that money can bring—all books, all travel, all art—are
not worth so much as the power to stand on one’s
own feet. It is an essential to the character, and it is
certainly the greatest of delights. To have earned, for
a single year, one’s own support, gives one, in a manner,
the freedom of the universe. Till that is done, we
are children: after that we are mature human beings.</p>

<p class='c014'>In England, where the whole social atmosphere is so
different, there are many instances of much service
done to art and philanthropy by persons born to leisure.
And yet, even in England, if the admissions of English
people may be trusted, these instances are bought by a
frightful disproportion of wasted lives; and the best
work is, after all, done by those who have learned to
stand on their own feet. This last fact is certainly true
of France, Germany, and America. So far as my own
observation goes, for one American born to leisure who
makes a good use of it, there are a dozen who lead empty
or vicious lives. And even that exceptional one, with
all his advantages, is often distanced in the race by the
men who have early had to stand on their own feet.
The man of leisure is usually so limited, either by the
absence of stimulus or by the tiresome narrowness of
a petty circle, or by missing the wholesome attrition of
other minds, that he dwindles and grows feeble. If
such a man attains by the aid of wealth what the man
of the next inferior grade attains without it, we are all
glad, and say it is “an honorable instance.” Not that
the rich are worse than other men. It is no calamity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>to earn wealth, or even to inherit it after we have
learned the lesson of self-reliance. It is the children
of wealth who are to be pitied.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, all women who are born outside of actual poverty
in America are as badly off as if they had been
born to wealth. They are systematically discouraged
from the delightful tonic of self-support. But when
it is said that they never even feel the desire to support
themselves, I must dissent. For twenty years I have
been encountering young women who so longed for the
sense of an independent position that even the happiest
paternal home could not satisfy them unless it gave
them so much to do that they might honestly feel that
they earned their living. Otherwise the most luxurious
arm-chairs in their own houses would not satisfy them,
they so longed to learn the use of their own feet. I
have known girls to rejoice in their father’s loss of
property, because it would release them to enjoy the
happiness of self-reliance; and, for one, had I the good
fortune to have a dozen daughters, I should wish them
all to be of this way of thinking. Any other theory
would give us a world of mere amateurs and dilettantes,
and very little work would be done. We are getting
over the theory that it is undignified for a man to stand
upon his own feet; and we shall one day get over it in
regard to women.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>MISS INGELOW’S PROBLEM.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In a certain New England town I lived opposite the
house of a thriving mechanic. His wife, a young and
pretty woman, soon attracted the attention of my household
by the grace and vivacity of her bearing, and the
peculiar tastefulness of her own and her little boy’s
costume. On further acquaintance, we found that she
did every atom of her housework, washing and all;
that she cut and made every garment for herself and
her child; and that, finding her energies still unsatisfied,
she took in sewing-work from a tailor’s shop, and thus
earned most of the money for their wardrobe. It may
be well to add, to complete this story of New England
social life, that her husband was one of the very earliest
volunteers for the war of the Rebellion; that he went in
captain, came out brigadier-general, and now holds an
important government office.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is nothing isolated or unexampled about this
instance. My pretty and ladylike neighbor was only
energetic, ready, capable, and ambitious, or, to sum
it all up in the New England vernacular, “smart.”
Whatever she saw in society or life that was desirable
for herself or her husband or her child, that she aimed
at, and generally obtained.</p>

<p class='c014'>She “hadn’t a lazy bone in her body;” and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>never will have, though she may wear that body out
prematurely by nervous tension. Wherever she goes,
she will carry the same restless, tireless energy; and,
should her husband ever go to Congress or to the Court
of St. James, she will carry herself with perfect fearlessness
and ease. And in all this she represents one
great type of New England women.</p>

<p class='c014'>When you ask of such a woman if she shrinks from
work, it is as if you asked, Does a deer shrink from
running, or a swallow from flying? She loves the work:
indeed she loves it, in my opinion, far too much, and
sets a dangerous example. All theories of the natural
indolence of man—or woman—fall defeated before
the New England temperament, traditions, training, climate;
before that “whip of the sky,” as a poet has
sung, that urges us on. If, therefore, “household
work is thought degrading,”—and Miss Ingelow asserts
too hastily that “nowhere is this so much the case as
in America,”—it certainly is not merely because it is
work.</p>

<p class='c014'>For myself, I doubt the fact, and demand the evidence.
So far as the free States of the Union are concerned,
it seems to me that household labor is thought
less degrading than in England, and that the proportion
of well-taught and ladylike women who contentedly do
their own work is far greater in America, and keeps
pace with the greater spread of average education.
There is not a city in the land, I suppose,—certainly
not a village,—where the housework in a large majority
of the American-born families is not done by Americans;
for the large majority are always mechanics and
laborers, among whom, as a rule, the work is done by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the wives and sisters and daughters. The wages of
domestics are so much higher in America than in England,—being
almost double,—that it is here a more
serious expenditure to employ such aid.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think, therefore, that we must be very cautious
before we say that housework, as such, is held degrading
in the free States. No doubt, American women
feel, as their husbands and brothers feel, that all
work should be done by machinery, as far as possible,
and that the washing-machine and the carpet-sweeper
are as legitimate as the patent reaper or
mower. They would be foolish if they did not. They
also feel, as American men feel, that, in this great assemblage
of all nations, the place for the American is
rather in posts of command than in the ranks. In our
ships you find men of all nations in the forecastle, but
Americans in the cabin. In the regular army it is the
officers, commissioned or non-commissioned, who are
Americans. Go as far west as you please, you are
surprised to find that the railway officials, superintendents,
conductors, baggage-masters, are not merely
American-born but often New-England-born. The
better average education tells. It is in the fitness of
things that the under-work of household life also should
be done by the under-class of foreign elements, and
that it should be Americans who do the direction and
guidance. Some such instinct as this is the explanation
of much that Miss Ingelow takes for a contempt of
household labor. An American woman does not despise
such labor, properly speaking, any more than an
American man despises mechanical labor. Both aim,
if they can, to rise to occupations more lucrative and
more intellectual.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>It is not the labor, it is not even the household
labor, to which objection is made. When you come to
household labor for other people, done in a capacity
recognized as menial,—ay, there’s the rub! There is a
widespread feeling that domestic service in other people’s
families is menial.</p>

<p class='c014'>For one I have publicly remonstrated against the
excess of this feeling, and think it is carried too far.
Women will never compete equally with men, until they
are willing, like men, to do any honest work without
sense of degradation. This is one point where enfranchisement
will help them. So long as a man bears in
his hand the ballot, that symbol of substantial equality,
his self-respect is not easily impaired by the humblest
position. “A man’s a man for a’ that,” he knows,
before the law. But a woman, not having this, has
only the usages of society to guide her; and, so long
as society talks about “master” and “servant,” I do
not blame the American girl for refusing to accept such
a position,—just as I do not blame, but applaud, the
American man for refusing to wear livery. I only
condemn them, in either case, when the alternative is
starvation or sin. Then pride should yield.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this is the conclusive proof that it is not the
housework which is held degrading: the fact that there
is no difficulty in securing any number of American girls
in our large country hotels, where they associate with
their employers as equals, and call no man master. The
fact that the proprietors of such hotels invariably prefer
American “help” to Irish, shows that the philosophy
of the whole question lies in a different direction from
that indicated by our good friend Miss Ingelow. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>evil of which she speaks does not properly exist: the
real difficulty lies in a different direction, and cannot be
settled till we see farther into the social organization
that is to come.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>SELF-SUPPORT.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is the English theory, that society needs a leisure
class, not self-supporting, from whom public services
and works of science and art may proceed. Even Darwin
recognizes this theory. But how little is England
doing for science and art, compared to Germany! and
the German work of that kind is not done by a leisure
class, but by poor men. I believe that the necessity
of self-support, at least in the earlier years of life,
is the best training for manhood; and it does not seem
desirable that women should be wholly set free from it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A clever writer, on the other hand, maintains in the
New York Independent that women should never support
themselves if it be possible honorably to avoid it.
“Pecuniary dependence, degrading to men, is not only
not undignified, but is the only thoroughly dignified
condition, for women. In a renovated and millennial
society all women will be supported by men,—will have
no more to do with bringing in money than the lilies of
the field.” This statement is delightfully uncompromising,
and it is a great thing to hear an extreme position
so clearly and unequivocally put. Especially on a
question so difficult as the labor and wages of women,
it is particularly desirable to have each extreme worked
out to its logical results.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>It is certainly the normal condition of woman to be
a wife and a mother. It is equally certain that this
condition withdraws woman from the labor-market,
during the prime of her life. The very years during
which a man attains his highest skill, and earns his
highest wages,—say, from twenty-five to forty,—are
lost to woman, in this normal condition, so far as earning
money is concerned. This is the main fact, as I
judge, which keeps down the standard of both work
and pay among women, as a class. If men, as a class,
were thus heavily weighted, the result would be as
clearly seen. Where one sex brings into the market
the full vigor of its life, and the other has only crude
labor, or occasional labor, or broken labor, to offer,
the result cannot be doubtful. Yet this is precisely the
state of the competition between man and woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>I believe, therefore, with this writer, that woman
was not intended to be the equal competitor of man in
business pursuits—or, indeed, to be self-supporting at
all—during her career of motherhood. It is generally
recognized as a calamity, when she is obliged to support
herself at that time. Most people believe with
Miss Mitford that “women were not meant to earn the
bread of a family,” and that men are. But to earn
the bread of a family is not self-support: it is much
more than self-support. And when this writer takes a
step beyond, and says, “I think the necessity of earning
her own living is always a woman’s misfortune,”
then she seems to theorize beyond good sense, and to
confuse things very different. Self-support is one
thing: supporting seven small children is quite another
thing.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>That which should never be left out of sight is the
essential dignity of labor. Woman during the period
of maternity is rightly excused from earning money;
but it is because she is better occupied. She is not
exempted in the character of lily of the field, but in
the capacity of mother of a family. It is an important
distinction. For labor in the lower sense, she substitutes
what, in a higher and more sacred sense, we still
call “labor.” She is not supported because she is a
woman, but because, in her capacity as woman, she
happens to have home-duties. If she had no such
duties, there seems no reason why she should be supported
any more than if she were a man. To be a
wife and mother is a vocation, and one which usually
for a time precludes all others. Merely to be a
woman is not a vocation; and, so long as one can
make no better claim on the world than that, the world
has a right to demand something more. The Irishwoman
who locks her little children into her one room,
that she may go out to earn their bread, seems to me
in a position no falser than that of the over-worked
father who breaks himself down with toil that his
daughters may live like the lilies of the field.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXV.<br /> <span class='large'>SELF-SUPPORTING WIVES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For one, I have never been fascinated by the style
of domestic paradise that English novels depict,—half
a dozen unmarried daughters round the family hearth,
all assiduously doing worsted-work and petting their
papa. I believe a sufficiency of employment to be the
only normal and healthy condition for a human being;
and where there is not work enough to employ the full
energies of all, at home, it seems as proper for young
women as for young birds to leave the parental nest.
If this additional work is done for money, very well.
It is the conscious dignity of self-support that removes
the traditional curse from labor, and woman has a
right to claim her share in that dignified position.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet I cannot agree, on the other hand, with Celia
Burleigh when she says that her “True Woman”
should be self-supporting, even in marriage. Women’s
part of the family task—the care of home and
children—is just as essential to building up the family
fortunes as the very different toil of the out-door partner.
For young married women to undertake any more
direct aid to the family income is in most cases utterly
undesirable, and is asking of themselves a great deal
too much. And this is not because they are to be encouraged
in indolence, but because they already, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>normal condition of things, have their hands full. As,
on this point, I may differ from some of my readers,
let me explain precisely what I mean.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I write, there are at work, in another part of the
house, two paper-hangers, a man and his wife, each
forty-five or fifty years of age. Their children are
grown up, and some of them married: they have a
daughter at home, who is old enough to do the housework,
and leave the mother free. There is no way of
organizing the labors of this household better than this:
the married pair toil together during the day, and go
home together to their evening rest. A happier couple I
never saw; it is a delight to see them cheerily at work
together, cutting, pasting, hanging: their life seems like
a prolonged industrial picnic; and, if I had the ill-luck
to own as many palaces as an English duke, I should
keep them permanently occupied in putting fresh papers
on the walls.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the merit of this employment for the woman is,
that it interferes with no other duty. Were she a
young mother with little children, and obliged by her
paper-hanging to neglect them, or to leave them at a
“day-nursery,” or to overwork herself by combining
too many cares, then the sight of her would be very sad.
So sacred a thing does motherhood seem to me, so paramount
and absorbing the duty of a mother to her
child, that in a true state of society I think she should
be utterly free from all other duties,—even, if possible,
from the ordinary cares of housekeeping. If she
has spare health and strength to do these other things
as pleasures, very well; but she should be relieved
from them as duties. And, as to the need of self-support,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>I can hardly conceive of an instance where it
can be to the mother of young children any thing but
a disaster. As we all know, this calamity often occurs;
I have seen it among the factory-operatives at the North,
and among the negro-women in the cotton-fields at the
South: in both cases it is a tragedy, and the bodies
and brains of mother and children alike suffer. That
the mother should bear and tend and nurture, while
the father supports and protects,—this is the true
division.</p>

<p class='c014'>Does this bear in any way upon suffrage? Not at
all. The mother can inform herself upon public questions
in the intervals of her cares, as the father among
his; and the baby in the cradle is a perpetual appeal to
her, as to him, that the institutions under which that
baby dwells may be kept pure. One of the most devoted
young mothers I ever knew—the younger sister
of Margaret Fuller Ossoli—made it a rule, no matter
how much her children absorbed her, to read books or
newspapers for an hour every day; in order, she said,
that their mother should be more than a mere source
of physical nurture, and that her mind should be kept
fresh and alive for them. But to demand in addition
that such a mother should earn money for them, is to
ask too much; and there is many a tombstone in New
England, which, if it told the truth, would tell what
comes of such an effort.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE PROBLEM OF WAGES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Talking, the other day, with one of the leading
dressmakers of a New England town, I asked her why
it was, that, when women suffered so much from scanty
employments and low pay, there should yet be so few
good dressmakers. “You are all overrun and worn
out with work,” I said, “all the year round; every
lady in town complains that there are so few of you;
and it is the same in every town where I ever lived.”
She answered, as such witnesses always answer, “Women
do not engage in occupations, as men do, for a lifetime.
They expect only to continue in them for a year
or two, until they shall be married. I employ twelve
girls, and not one of them expects to be a dressmaker
for life. They work their ten hours a day, under my
direction, and that is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here lies the point of difference between the work of
women and that of men, as a class: I mean, in their
industrial pursuits, the work that earns money. Until
we reach this point, or get a social philosophy that
explains this, we are yet upon the surface only. The
enfranchisement of woman will help us towards this,
but will not, of itself, solve the problem of wages;
because that depends on other than political considerations.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Why do the mass of men work? Not from taste,
or for love of the work, but from conscious need. If
they do not work, they and their families will starve.
It is a necessity, and a permanent necessity. It will
last all their lives, except in the case of a few who
will “come into their property” by and by, like Mr.
Toots—and their work is usually worth about as much
as his. We see this every day in the sons of rich
men. Their fathers may bring them up to work, yet
the mere fact that they are to be relieved from this
compulsion within a dozen years is apt to paralyze
their active faculties. They study law or medicine, or
dabble in “business;” but they only play at the practice
of their pursuits, because there is no conscious
necessity behind them. There are exceptions, but the
exceptions are remarkable men.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, theorize as we may, the fact at present is, that
what thus paralyzes the energies of a few young men
brings the same paralysis to many young women.
Those whose parents are wealthy do not learn any
regular occupation at all. Those whose parents are
poor are obliged by necessity to learn one: yet they do
not learn it as men in general learn theirs, but only as
rich young men do, as if it were something to be followed
for a time only,—till they “come into their
property.” To the rich young man the property is a
landed estate or some bank-stock. To the poor girl
the prospective property is a husband. She expects to
be married; and after that her money-making occupation
is gone, and a new avocation—that of housekeeping
and maternity—begins. It is no less arduous, no
less honorable; but it is different. In it her previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>special training goes for nothing; and the thought of
this must diminish her interest in the previous special
training. It is only a temporary thing, like the few
years’ labor of a rich young man. There are exceptions,
but they are extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c014'>One reason why women’s work is not at present so
well paid as that of men is because it is not ordinarily
so well done, especially in the more difficult parts.
All employers, male and female, tell you this; and one
great reason why it is not so well done is because
women have not, as men have, a spring of permanent
necessity to urge them on. How shall we supply the
spring? This is the question we need to answer. As
yet I do not think we have reached it. It does not
seem to me to be, like the suffrage question, one easily
settled. The reader will find very important facts and
testimonies bearing upon it in Virginia Penny’s “Cyclopædia
of Female Employments.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. Especially on pp. 110, 146, 235, 238, 243, 245, 247, 300, 318, 322, 367, 380.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I confess myself unable, even after a good many
years of study, to solve it fully; but a few propositions,
I think, are sure, and may be taken as axioms to
begin with. The general wages of women will always
depend greatly on the amount of skill acquired by the
mass of them. The mass of women will always look
forward to being married, and, when married, to being
necessarily withdrawn from the labor-market. Those
who look forward to this withdrawal will not, as a rule,
concentrate themselves upon learning their vocation as
if it were for life; and, at any rate, when they leave it,
they will take their skill with them, and so lower the
average skill of the whole.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>The problem, therefore, is, how to equalize wages
between a sex which works continually throughout life,
driven by conscious necessity, and a sex which habitually
works with temporary expectations, looking forward
to a withdrawal from the labor-market in a few
years, and which, when so withdrawn, carries its acquired
skill with it, leaving only inexperience in its
place. We all wish to solve the problem: every man
would like to have his daughters as well paid for their
labor as his sons. The ballot will help to elucidate it,
no doubt, by putting woman’s political protection, at
least, into her own hands: but wholly to solve the problem
will take the wisdom of several generations; nor
will it be done, perhaps, until the greater problem of
association <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vs.</span></i> competition is also understood. It certainly
never will be solved by slighting the marriage-relation,
or by advocating either “free love” or celibacy
for women or for men.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THOROUGH.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The hopeless defect of women in all practical matters,”
said a shrewd merchant the other day, “is, that
it is impossible to make them thorough.” It was
a shallow remark, and so I told him. Women are
thorough in the things which they have accepted as
their sphere,—in their housekeeping and their dress
and their social observances. There is nothing more
thorough on earth than the way housework is done in a
genuine New England household. There is an exquisite
thoroughness in the way a milliner’s or a dressmaker’s
work is done,—a work such as clumsy man cannot rival,
and can hardly estimate. No general plans his campaigns
or marshals his armies better than some women
of society manage the circles of which they are the
centre. Day and night, winter and summer, at city or
watering-place, year in and year out, such a woman
keeps open house for her gay world. She has a perpetual
series of guests who must be fed luxuriously, and
amused profusely; she talks to them in four or five languages;
at her entertainments, she notes who is present
and who absent, as carefully as Napoleon watched his
soldiers; her interchange of cards, alone, is a thing as
complex as the army muster-rolls: thus she plans, organizes,
conquers, and governs. People speak of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>existence as that of a doll or a toy, when she is the
most untiring of campaigners. Grant that her aim is,
after all, unworthy, and that you pity the worn face
which has to force so many smiles. No matter: the
smiles are there, and so is the success. I often wish
that the reformers would do their work as thoroughly
as the women of society do theirs.</p>

<p class='c014'>No, there is no constitutional want of thoroughness
in women. The trouble is, that into the new work upon
which they are just entering, they have not yet brought
their thoroughness to bear. They suffer and are defrauded
and are reproached, simply because they have
not yet nerved themselves to do well the things which
they have asserted their right to do. A distinguished
woman, who earns perhaps the largest income ever
honestly earned by any woman off the stage, told me
the other day that she left all her business affairs to
the management of others, and did not even know how
to draw a check on a bank. What a melancholy self-exhibition
was that of a clever American woman, the
author of half a dozen successful books, refusing to
look her own accounts in the face until they had got
into such a tangle that not even her own referees could
disentangle them to suit her! These things show, not
that women are constitutionally wanting in thoroughness,
but that it is hard to make them carry this quality
into new fields.</p>

<p class='c014'>I wish I could possibly convey to the young women
who write for advice on literary projects something of
the meaning of this word “thorough” as applied to
literary work. Scarcely any of them seem to have a
conception of it. Dash, cleverness, recklessness, impatience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of revision or of patient investigation, these
are the common traits. To a person of experience, no
stupidity is so discouraging as a brilliancy that has no
roots. It brings nothing to pass; whereas a slow stupidity,
if it takes time enough, may conquer the world.
Consider that for more than twenty years the path of
literature has been quite as fully open for women as for
men, in America,—the payment the same, the honor
the same, the obstacles no greater. Collegiate education
has until very lately been denied them, but how many
men succeed as writers without that advantage! Yet
how little, how very little, of really good literary work
has yet been done by American women! Young girls appear
one after another: each writes a single clever story
or a single sweet poem, and then disappears forever.
Look at Griswold’s “Female Poets of America,” and
you are disposed to turn back to the title-page, and see
if these utterly forgotten names do not really represent
the “female poets” of some other nation. They are
forgotten, as most of the more numerous “female
prose writers” are forgotten, because they had no root.
Nobody doubts that women have cleverness enough,
and enough of power of expression. If you could open
the mails, and take out the women’s letters, as somebody
says, they would prove far more graphic and
entertaining than those of the men. They would be
written, too, in what Macaulay calls—speaking of
Madame d’Arblay’s early style—“true woman’s English,
clear, natural, and lively.” What they need, in
order to convert this epistolary brilliancy into literature,
is to be thorough.</p>

<p class='c014'>You cannot separate woman’s rights and her responsibilities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>In all ages of the world she has had a certain
limited work to do, and has done that well. All that
is needed, when new spheres are open, is that she
should carry the same fidelity into those. If she will
work as hard to shape the children of her brain as to
rear her bodily offspring, will do intellectual work as
well as she does housework, and will meet her moral
responsibilities as she meets her social engagements,
then opposition will soon disappear. The habit of
thoroughness is the key to all high success. Whatever
is worth doing is worth doing well. Only those who
are faithful in a few things will rightfully be made rulers
over many.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>LITERARY ASPIRANTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The brilliant Lady Ashburton used to say of herself
that she had never written a book, and knew nobody
whose book she would like to have written. This does
not seem to be the ordinary state of mind among those
who write letters of inquiry to authors. If I may judge
from these letters, the yearning for a literary career
is just now greater among women than among men.
Perhaps it is because of some literary successes lately
achieved by women. Perhaps it is because they have
fewer outlets for their energies. Perhaps they find
more obstacles in literature than young men find, and
have, therefore, more need to write letters of inquiry
about it. It is certain that they write such letters quite
often; and ask questions that test severely the supposed
omniscience of the author’s brain,—questions
bearing on logic, rhetoric, grammar, and orthography;
how to find a publisher, and how to obtain a well-disciplined
mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>These letters may sometimes be too long or come too
often for convenience, nor is the consoling postage-stamp
always remembered. But they are of great
value as giving real glimpses of American social life,
and of the present tendencies of American women.
They sometimes reveal such intellectual ardor and imagination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>such modesty, and such patience under difficulties,
as to do good to the reader, whatever they
may do to the writer. They certainly suggest a few
thoughts, which may as well be expressed, once for all,
in print.</p>

<p class='c014'>Behind almost all these letters there lies a laudable
desire to achieve success. “Would you have the goodness
to tell us how success can be obtained?” How
can this be answered, my dear young lady, when you
leave it to the reader to guess what your definition of
success may be? For instance, here is Mr. Mansfield
Tracy Walworth, who was murdered the other day in
New York. He was at once mentioned in the newspapers
as a “celebrated author.” Never in my life
having heard of him, I looked in Hart’s “Manual of
American Literature,” and there found that Mr. Walworth’s
novel of “Warwick” had a sale of seventy-five
thousand copies, and his “Delaplaine” of forty-five
thousand. Is it a success to have secured a sale
like that for your books, and then to die, and have
your brother penmen ask, “Who was he?” Yet,
certainly, a sale of seventy-five thousand copies is not
to be despised; and I fear I know many youths and
maidens who would willingly write novels much poorer
than “Warwick” for the sake of a circulation like
that. I do not think that Hawthorne, however, would
have accepted these conditions; and he certainly did
not have this style of success.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nor do I think he had any right to expect it. He
had made his choice, and had reason to be satisfied.
The very first essential for literary success is to decide
what success means. If a young girl pines after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>success of Marion Harland and Mrs. Southworth, let
her seek it. It is possible that she may obtain it, or
surpass it; and, though she might do better, she might
do far worse. It is, at any rate, a laudable aim to be
popular: popularity may be a very creditable thing,
unless you pay too high a price for it. It is a pleasant
thing, and has many contingent advantages,—balanced
by this great danger, that one is apt to mistake it for
success.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Learning hath made the most,” said old Fuller,
“by those books on which the booksellers have lost.”
If this be true of learning, it is quite as true of genius
and originality. A book may be immediately popular
and also immortal, but the chances are the other way.
It is more often the case, that a great writer gradually
creates the taste by which he is enjoyed. Wordsworth
in the last generation and Emerson in the present have
been striking instances of this; and authors of far
less fame have yet the same choice which they had.
You can take the standard which the book-market
offers, and train yourself for that. This will, in the
present age, be sure to educate certain qualities in you,—directness,
vividness, animation, dash,—even if it
leaves other qualities untrained. Or you can make a
standard of your own, and aim at that, taking your
chance of seeing the public agree with you. Very
likely you may fail; perhaps you may be wrong in your
fancy, after all, and the public may be right: if you
fail, you may find it hard to bear; but, on the other
hand, you may have the inward “glory and joy” which
nothing but fidelity to an ideal standard can give. All
this applies to all forms of work, but it applies conspicuously
to literature.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Instead, therefore, of offering to young writers the
usual comforting assurance, that, if they produce any
thing of real merit, it will be sure to succeed, I should
caution them first to make their own definition of
success, and then act accordingly. Hawthorne succeeded
in his way, and Mr. M. T. Walworth in his way;
and each of these would have been very unreasonable
if he had expected to succeed in both ways. There is
always an opening for careful and conscientious literary
work; and, by such work, many persons obtain a
modest support. There are also some great prizes to
be won; but these are commonly, though not always,
won by work of a more temporary and sensational
kind. Make your choice; and, when you have got
precisely what you asked for, do not complain because
you have missed what you would not take.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>“THE CAREER OF LETTERS.”</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c013'>A young girl of some talent once told me that she
had devoted herself to “the career of letters.” I
found, on inquiry, that she had obtained a situation as
writer of “society” gossip for a New York newspaper.
I can hardly imagine any life that leads more directly
away from any really literary career, or any life about
which it is harder to give counsel. The work of a
newspaper-correspondent, especially in the “society”
direction, is so full of trials and temptations, for one of
either sex, in our dear, inquisitive, gossiping America,
that one cannot help watching with especial solicitude
all women who enter it. Their special gifts as women
are a source of danger: they are keener of observation
from the very fact of their sex, more active in curiosity,
more skilful in achieving their ends; in a world of
gossip they are the queens, and men but their subjects,
hence their greater danger.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Newport, New York, Washington, it is the same
thing. The unbounded appetite for private information
about public or semi-public people creates its own purveyors;
and these, again, learn to believe with unflinching
heartiness in the work they do. I have rarely
encountered a successful correspondent of this description
who had not become thoroughly convinced that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>highest desire of every human being is to see his name
in print, no matter how. Unhappily there is a great
deal to encourage this belief: I have known men to
express great indignation at an unexpected newspaper-puff,
and then to send ten dollars privately to the
author. This is just the calamity of the profession,
that it brings one in contact with this class of social
hypocrites; and the “personal” correspondent gradually
loses faith that there is any other class to be
found. Then there is the perilous temptation to pay off
grudges in this way, to revenge slights, by the use of
a power with which few people are safely to be trusted.
In many cases, such a correspondent is simply a child
playing with poisoned arrows: he poisons others; and it
is no satisfaction to know that in time he will also poison
himself, and paralyze his own power for mischief.</p>

<p class='c014'>There lies before me a letter written some years ago
to a young lady anxious to enter on this particular
“career of letters,”—a letter from an experienced
New York journalist. He has employed, he says, hundreds
of lady correspondents, for little or no compensation;
and one of his few successful writers he thus
describes: “She succeeds by pushing her way into
society, and extracting information from fashionable
people and officials and their wives.... She flatters
the vain, and overawes the weak, and gets by sheer
impudence what other writers cannot.... I would
not wish you to be like her, or reduced to the necessity
of doing what she does, for any success journalism can
possibly give.” And who can help echoing this opinion?
If this is one of the successful laborers, where
shall we place the unsuccessful; or, rather, is success,
or failure, the greater honor?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Personal journalism has a prominence in this country
with which nothing in any other country can be compared.
What is called publicity in England or France
means the most peaceful seclusion, compared with the
glare of notoriety which an enterprising correspondent
can flash out at any time—as if by opening the bull’s-eye
of a dark lantern—upon the quietest of his contemporaries.
It is essentially an American institution,
and not one of those in which we have reason to feel
most pride. It is to be observed, however, that foreigners,
if in office, take to it very readily; and it is said that
no people cultivate the reporters at Washington more
assiduously than the diplomatic corps, who like to
send home the personal notices of themselves, in order
to prove to their governments that they are highly esteemed
in the land to which they are appointed. But,
however it may be with them, it is certain that many
people still like to keep their public and private lives
apart, and shrink from even the inevitable eminence
of fame. One of the very most popular of American
authors has said that he never, to this day, has overcome
a slight feeling of repugnance on seeing his own
name in print.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXX.<br /> <span class='large'>TALKING AND TAKING.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Every time a woman does any thing original or remarkable,—inventing
a rat-trap, let us say, or carving
thirty-six heads on a walnut-shell,—all observers shout
applause. “There’s a woman for you, indeed! Instead
of talking about her rights, she takes them.
That’s the way to do it. What a lesson to these declaimers
upon the platform!”</p>

<p class='c014'>It does not seem to occur to these wise people that
the right to talk is itself one of the chief rights in
America, and the way to reach all the others. To
talk, is to make a beginning, at any rate. To catch
people with your ideas, is more than to contrive a rat-trap;
and Isotta Nogarola, carving thirty-six empty
heads, was not working in so practical a fashion as
Mary Livermore when she instructs thirty-six hundred
full ones.</p>

<p class='c014'>It shows the good sense of the woman suffrage agitators,
that they have decided to begin with talk. In
the first place, talking is the most lucrative of all professions
in America; and therefore it is the duty of
American women to secure their share of it. Mrs.
Frances Anne Kemble used to say that she read Shakspeare
in public “for her bread;” and when, after
melting all hearts by a course of farewell readings, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>decided to begin reading again, she said she was
doing it “for her butter.” So long as women are
often obliged to support themselves and their children,
and perhaps their husbands, by their own labor, they
have no right to work cheaply, unless driven to it.
Anna Dickinson has no right to make fifteen dollars a
week by sewing, if, by stepping out of the ranks of
needle-women into the ranks of the talkers, she can
make a hundred dollars a day. Theorize as we may, the
fact is, that there is no kind of work in America which
brings such sure profits as public speaking. If women
are unfitted for it, or if they “know the value of peace
and quietness,” as the hand-organ-man says, and can
afford to hold their tongues, let them do so. But if
they have tongues, and like to use them, they certainly
ought to make some money by the performance.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is the utilitarian view. And when we bring in
higher objects, it is plain that the way to get any thing
in America is to talk about it. Silence is golden, no
doubt, and like other gold remains in the bank-vaults,
and does not just now circulate very freely as currency.
Even literature in America is utterly second to oratory
as a means of immediate influence. Of all sway, that
of the orator is the most potent and most perishable;
and the student and the artist are apt to hold themselves
aloof from it, for this reason. But it is the one means
in America to accomplish immediate results, and women
who would take their rights must take them through
talking. It is the appointed way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Under a good old-fashioned monarchy, if a woman
wished to secure any thing for her sex, she must cajole
a court, or become the mistress of a monarch. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>epoch ended with the French Revolution. When Bonaparte
wished to silence Madame de Staël, he said,
“What does that woman want? Does she want the
money the government owes to her father?” When
Madame de Staël heard of it, she said, “The question
is not what I want, but what I think.” Henceforth
women, like men, are to say what they think. For all
that flattery and seduction and sin, we have substituted
the simple weapon of talk. If women wish education,
they must talk; if better laws, they must talk. The
one chief argument against woman suffrage, with men,
is that so few women even talk about it.</p>

<p class='c014'>As long as talk can effect any thing, it is the duty of
women to talk; and in America, where it effects every
thing, they should talk all the time. When they have
obtained, as a class, absolute equality of rights with
men, their talk on this subject may be silent, and they
may accept, if they please, that naughty masculine definition
of a happy marriage,—the union of a deaf man
with a dumb woman.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>HOW TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There are other things that women wish to do, it
seems, beside studying and voting. There are a good
many—if I may judge from letters that occasionally
come to me—who are taking, or wish to take, their
first lessons in public speaking. Not necessarily very
much in public, or before mixed audiences, but perhaps
merely to say to a room-full of ladies, or before the committee
of a Christian Union, what they desire to say.
“How shall I make myself heard? How shall I learn
to express myself? How shall I keep my head clear?
Is there any school for debate?” And so on. My
dear young lady, it does not take much wisdom, but
only a little experience, to answer some of these questions.
So I am not afraid to try.</p>

<p class='c014'>The best school for debate is debating. So far as
mere confidence and comfort are concerned, the great
thing is to gain the habit of speech, even if one speaks
badly. And the practice of an ordinary debating society
has also this advantage, that it teaches you to talk
sense (lest you be laughed at), to speak with some animation
(lest your hearers go to sleep), to think out
some good arguments (because you are trying to convince
somebody), and to guard against weak reasoning
or unfounded assertion (lest your opponent trip you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>up). Speaking in a debating society thus gives you
the same advantage that a lawyer derives from the
presence of an opposing counsel: you learn to guard
yourself at all points. It is the absence of this check
which is the great intellectual disadvantage of the pulpit.
When a lawyer says a foolish thing in an argument, he
is pretty sure to find it out; but a clergyman may go
on repeating his foolish thing for fifty years without
finding it out, for want of an opponent.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the art of making your voice heard, I must refer
you to an elocutionist. Yet one thing at least you
might acquire for yourself,—a thing that lies at the
foundation of all good speaking,—the complete and
thorough enunciation of every syllable. So great is the
delight, to my ear at least, of a perfectly distinct and
clear-cut utterance, that I fear I should rather listen
for an hour to the merest nonsense, so uttered, than to
the very wisdom of angels if given in a confused or
nasal or slovenly way. If you wish to know what I
mean by a clear and satisfactory utterance, go to the
next woman suffrage convention, and hear Miss Eastman.</p>

<p class='c014'>As to your employment of language, the great aim
is to be simple, and, in a measure, conversational, and
then let eloquence come of itself. If most people
talked as well in public as in private, public meetings
would be more interesting. To acquire a conversational
tone, there is good sense in Edward Hale’s suggestion,
that every person who is called on to speak,—let
us say, at a public dinner,—instead of standing up
and talking about his surprise at being called on, should
simply make his last remark to his neighbor at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>table the starting-point for what he says to the whole
company. He will thus make sure of a perfectly natural
key, to begin with; and can go on from this quiet
“As I was just saying to Mr. Smith,” to discuss the
gravest question of Church or State. It breaks the ice
for him, like the remark upon the weather by which we
open our interview with the person whom we have longed
for years to meet. Beginning in this way at the level
of the earth’s surface, we can join hands and rise to the
clouds. Begin in the clouds,—as some of my most
esteemed friends are wont to do,—and you have to sit
down before reaching the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, to come last to what is first in importance, I
am taking it for granted that you have something to
say, and a strong desire to say it. Perhaps you can
say it better for writing it out in full beforehand. But,
whether you do this or not, remember that the more
simple and consecutive your thought, the easier it will
be both to keep it in mind and to utter it. The more
orderly your plan, the less likely you will be to “get
bewildered,” or to “lose the thread.” Think it out
so clearly that the successive parts lead to one another,
and then there will be little strain upon your memory.
For each point you make, provide at least one good
argument and one good illustration, and you can, after
a little practice, safely leave the rest to the suggestion
of the moment. But so much as this you must have,
to be secure. Methods of preparation of course vary
extremely; yet I suppose the secret of the composure
of an experienced speaker to lie usually in this, that
he has made sure beforehand of a sufficient number of
good points to carry him through, even if nothing good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>should occur to him on the spot. Thus wise people, in
going on a fishing-excursion, take with them not merely
their fishing-tackle, but a few fish; and then, if they
are not sure of their luck, they will be sure of their
chowder.</p>

<p class='c014'>These are some of the simple hints that might be
given, in answer to inquiring friends. I can remember
when they would have saved me some anguish of spirit;
and they may be of some use to others now. I
write, then, not to induce any one to talk for the sake
of talking,—Heaven forbid!—but that those who are
longing to say something should not fancy the obstacles
insurmountable, when they are really slight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That liberty, or freedom, consists in having an actual
share in the appointment of those who frame the laws, and
who are to be the guardians of every man’s life, property, and
peace; for the all of one man is as dear to him as the all of
another, and the poor man has an equal right, but more need,
to have representatives in the legislature than the rich one.
That they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of
representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved
to those who have votes, and to their representatives;
for to be enslaved is to have governors whom other men have
set over us, and be subject to laws made by the representatives
of others, without having had representatives of our own
to give consent in our behalf.”—<span class='sc'>Benjamin Franklin</span>, <em>in
Sparks’s Franklin</em>, ii. 372.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>WE THE PEOPLE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I remember, that, when I went to school, I used to
look with wonder on the title of a newspaper of those
days which was often in the hands of one of the older
scholars. I remember nothing else about the newspaper,
or about the boy, except that the title of the sheet
he used to unfold was “We the People;” and that he
derived from it his school nickname, by a characteristic
boyish parody, and was usually mentioned as “Us the
Folks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably all that was taught in that school, in regard
to American history, was not of so much value as the
permanent fixing of this phrase in our memories. It
seemed very natural, in later years, to come upon my
old friend “Us the Folks,” reproduced in almost every
charter of our national government, as thus:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>We the People</span> of the United States, in order to form a
more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
provide for the common defence, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the
United States of America.”—<cite>United States Constitution, Preamble.</cite></p>

<p class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>We the People</span> of Maine do agree,” etc.—<cite>Constitution
of Maine.</cite></p>

<p class='c021'>“All government of right originates from <span class='fss'>THE PEOPLE</span>, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>founded in their consent, and instituted for the general good.”—<cite>Constitution
of New Hampshire.</cite></p>

<p class='c021'>“The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of
individuals; it is a social compact, by which <span class='fss'>THE WHOLE
PEOPLE</span> covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with
the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws
for the common good.”—<cite>Constitution of Massachusetts.</cite></p>

<p class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>We the People</span> of the State of Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations&nbsp;... do ordain and establish this constitution
of government.”—<cite>Constitution of Rhode Island.</cite></p>

<p class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>The People</span> of Connecticut do, in order more effectually
to define, secure, and perpetuate the liberties, rights, and privileges
which they have derived from their ancestors, hereby
ordain and establish the following constitution and form of
civil government.”—<cite>Constitution of Connecticut.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>And so on through the constitutions of almost every
State in the Union. Our government is, as Lincoln
said, “a government of the people, by the people, and
for the people.” There is no escaping it. To question
this is to deny the foundations of the American government.
Granted that those who framed these provisions
may not have understood the full extent of the principles
they announced. No matter: they gave us those
principles; and, having them, we must apply them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, women may be voters or not, citizens or not;
but that they are a part of the people, no one has denied
in Christendom—however it may be in Japan,
where, as Mrs. Leonowens tells us, the census of population
takes in only men, and the women and children
are left to be inferred. “<span class='sc'>We the people</span>,” then, includes
women. Be the superstructure what it may, the
foundation of the government clearly provides a place
for them: it is impossible to state the national theory
in such a way that it shall not include them. It is impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>to deny the natural right of women to vote,
except on grounds which exclude all natural right. Dr.
Bushnell, in annihilating, as he thinks, the claims of
women to the ballot, annihilates the rights of the community
as a whole, male or female. He may not be
consistent enough to allow this, but Mr. Wasson is.
That keen destructive strikes at the foundation of the
building, and aims to demolish “We the people” altogether.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fundamental charters are on our side. There are
certain statute limitations which may prove greater or
less. But these are temporary and trivial things, always
to be interpreted, often to be modified, by reference to
the principles of the Constitution. For instance, when
a constitutional convention is to be held, or new conditions
of suffrage to be created, the whole people should
vote upon the matter, including those not hitherto enfranchised.
This is the view insisted on, a few years
since, by that eminent jurist, William Beach Lawrence.
He maintained, in a letter to Charles Sumner and in
opposition to his own party, that if the question of
“negro suffrage” in the Southern States of the Union
were put to vote, the colored people themselves had a
natural right to vote on the question. The same is
true of women. It should never be forgotten by advocates
of woman suffrage, that, the deeper their reasonings
go, the stronger foundation they find; and that we
have always a solid fulcrum for our lever in that phrase
of our charters, “We the people.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE USE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When young people begin to study geometry, they
expect to begin with hard reasoning on the very first
page. To their surprise, they find that the first few
pages are not occupied by reasoning, but by a few
simple, easy, and rather commonplace sentences, called
“axioms,” which are really a set of pegs on which all
the reasoning is hung. Pupils are not expected to go
back in every demonstration, and prove the axioms. If
Almira Jones happens to be doing a problem at the
blackboard on examination-day, at the high school, and
remarks in the course of her demonstration that “things
which are equal to the same thing are equal to one
another,” and if a sharp questioner jumps up, and
says, “How do you know it?” she simply lays down
her bit of chalk, and says fearlessly, “That is an
axiom,” and the teacher sustains her. Some things
must be taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same service rendered by axioms in the geometry
is supplied, in regard to government, by the simple
principles of the Declaration of Independence.
Right or wrong, they are taken for granted. Inasmuch
as all the legislation of the country is supposed to be
based in them,—they stating the theory of our government,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>while the Constitution itself only puts into
organic shape the application,—we must all begin
with them. It is a great convenience, and saves great
trouble in all reforms. To the Abolitionists, for instance,
what an inestimable labor-saving machine was
the Declaration of Independence! Let them have that,
and they asked no more. Even the brilliant lawyer
Rufus Choate, when confronted with its plain provisions,
could only sneer at them as “glittering generalities,”
which was equivalent to throwing down his brief, and
throwing up his case. It was an admission, that, if
you were so foolish as to insist on applying the first
principles of the government, it was all over with him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, the whole doctrine of woman suffrage follows
so directly from these same political axioms, that they
are especially convenient for women to have in the
house. When the Declaration of Independence enumerates
as among “self-evident” truths the fact of
governments “deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed,” then that point may be
considered as settled. In this school-examination of
maturer life, in this grown-up geometry-class, the student
is not to be called upon by the committee to prove
that. She may rightfully lay down her demonstrating
chalk, and say, “That is an axiom. You admit that
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a great convenience. We cannot always be
going back, like a Hindoo history, to the foundations
of the world. Some things may be taken for granted.
How this simple axiom sweeps away, for instance, the
cobweb speculations as to whether voting is a natural
right, or a privilege delegated by society! No matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>which. Take it which way you please. That is an
abstract question; but the practical question is a very
simple one. “Governments owe their just powers
to the consent of the governed.” Either that axiom
is false, or, whenever women as a class refuse their
consent to the present exclusively masculine government,
it can no longer claim just powers. The remedy
then may be rightly demanded, which the Declaration
of Independence goes on to state: “Whenever any
form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute a new government, laying its foundation on
such principles, and organizing its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety
and happiness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This is the use of the Declaration of Independence.
Women, as a class, may not be quite ready to use it.
It is the business of this book to help make them ready.
But, so far as they are ready, these plain provisions are
the axioms of their political faith. If the axioms mean
any thing for men, they mean something for women. If
men deride the axioms, it is a concession, like that of
Rufus Choate, that these fundamental principles are very
much in their way. But, so long as the sentences stand
in that document, they can be made useful. If men try
to get away from the arguments of women by saying,
“But suppose we have nothing in our theory of government
which requires us to grant your demand?” then
women can answer, as the straightforward Traddles
answered Uriah Heep, “But you have, you know:
therefore, if you please, we won’t suppose any such
thing.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is fortunate for reformers that our fathers were
clear-headed men. If they did not foresee all the
applications of their own principles,—and who does?—they
at least stated those principles very distinctly.
This is a great convenience to us who preach, in season
and out of season, on the texts they gave. Thus we
are constantly told, “You are mistaken in thinking
that the fathers of the Republic, when they proclaimed
‘taxation without representation,’ referred to individual
rights. They were speaking only of national
rights. They fought for national independence, not for
personal rights at all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is in order to refute this sort of reasoning that
women very often need to read American history
afresh. They will soon be satisfied that such reasoning
may be met with a plain, distinct denial. It
is contrary to the facts. The plain truth is, that our
fathers not only did not make national independence
their exclusive aim, but they did not make it an aim at
all until the war had actually begun. “I verily believe,”
wrote the brave Dr. Warren, “that the night
preceding the barbarous outrages committed by the
soldiery at Lexington, Concord, etc., there were not
fifty people in the whole colony that ever expected any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>blood would be shed in the contest between us and
Great Britain.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What was it, then, that had kept the colonists in a
turmoil for years? Let us see.</p>

<p class='c014'>On Monday, the 6th of March, 1775, the “freeholders
and other inhabitants of Boston” met in town-meeting
at Faneuil Hall, Samuel Adams being moderator.
The committee appointed, the year before, to
appoint an orator “to perpetuate the memory of the
horrid massacre perpetrated on the evening of the 5th
of March, 1770, by a party of soldiers,” reported that
they had selected Joseph Warren, Esq. The meeting
confirmed this, and adjourned to meet at the Old South
at half-past eleven, Faneuil Hall being too small. At
the appointed hour, the church was crowded. The
pulpit was draped in black. Forty British officers, in
uniform, sat in the front pews or on the gallery-stairs.
So great was the crowd, that Warren, in his orator’s
robe, entered the pulpit by a ladder through the window.
He stood there before the representatives of
royalty, and in defiance of the “Regulating Act,” one
of whose objects was to suppress meetings for any
such purpose. What doctrines did he stand there to
proclaim?</p>

<p class='c014'>Richard Frothingham in his admirable “Life of
Warren”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a> states the following as the fundamental
proposition of this celebrated address:—</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. p. 430.</p>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That personal freedom is the right of every man, and that
property, or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly
acquired by his own labor, necessarily arises therefrom,
are truths which common-sense has placed beyond the reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of contradiction; and no man or body of men can, without
being guilty of flagrant injustice, claim a right to dispose of
the persons or acquisitions of any other man, or body of men,
unless it can be proved that such a right had arisen from some
compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly
and freely granted.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The orator then traced,” says Frothingham, “the
rise and progress of the aggressions on the natural
right of the colonists to enjoy personal freedom and
representative government.” Not a word in behalf
of national independence: on the contrary, he said,
“An independence on Great Britain is not our aim.
No: our wish is that Britain and the colonies may, like
the oak and ivy, grow and increase together.” What
he protested against was the taking of individual property
without granting the owner a voice in it, personally
or through some authorized representative. And—observe!—this
authorization must not be a merely negative
or vaguely understood thing: it must be attested
by “some compact between the parties in which it has
been explicitly and freely granted.” Any thing short
of this was “a wicked policy,” under whose influence
the American had begun to behold the Briton as a
ruffian, ready “first to take his property, and next,
what is dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of
his country.” The loss of the country’s liberty was
thus staked as a result, a deduction, a corollary; the
original offence lay in the violation of the natural
right of each to control his own personal freedom
and personal property, or else, if these must be subordinated
to the public good, to have at least a voice in
the matter. This, and nothing else than this, was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>principle of those who fought the Revolution, according
to the statement of their first eminent martyr.</p>

<p class='c014'>And it was for announcing these great doctrines, and
for sealing them, three months later, with his blood,
that it was said of him, on the fifth of March following,
“We will erect a monument to thee in each of our
grateful hearts, and to the latest ages will teach our
tender infants to lisp the name of Warren with veneration
and applause.” That the opinions he expressed
were the opinions current among the people, is proved
by the general use of the cry “ Liberty and Property”
among all classes, at the time of the Stamp Act; a cry
which puzzles the young student, until he sees that the
Revolution really began with personal rights, and only
slowly reached the demand for national independence.
“Liberty and Property” was just as distinctly the claim
of Joseph Warren as it is the claim of those women who
now refuse to pay taxes because they believe in the
principles of the American Revolution.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>SOME OLD-FASHIONED PRINCIPLES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There has been an effort, lately, to show that when
our fathers said, “Taxation without representation is
tyranny,” they referred not to personal liberties, but
to the freedom of a state from foreign power. It is
fortunate that this criticism has been made, for it has
led to a more careful examination of passages; and
this has made it clear, beyond dispute, that the Revolutionary
patriots carried their statements more into
detail than is generally supposed, and affirmed their
principles for individuals, not merely for the state as a
whole.</p>

<p class='c014'>In that celebrated pamphlet by James Otis, for instance,
published as early as 1764, “The Rights of the
Colonies Vindicated,” he thus clearly lays down the
rights of the individual as to taxation:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“The very act of taxing, exercised over those who are not
represented, appears to me to be depriving them of one of their
most essential rights as freemen; and, if continued, seems to
be, in effect, an entire disfranchisement of every civil right.
For what one civil right is worth a rush, after a man’s property
is subject to be taken from him at pleasure, without his consent?
If a man is not his own assessor, in person or by deputy,
his liberty is gone, or he is entirely at the mercy of others.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. Otis: Rights of the Colonies, p. 58.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>This fine statement has already done duty for liberty,
in another contest; for it was quoted by Mr. Sumner in
his speech of March 7, 1866, with this commentary:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Stronger words for universal suffrage could not be employed.
His argument is, that, if men are taxed without being represented,
they are deprived of essential rights; and the continuance
of this deprivation despoils them of every civil right, thus
making the latter depend upon the right of suffrage, which by
a neologism of our day is known as a political right instead of
a civil right. Then, to give point to this argument, the patriot
insists that in determining taxation, ‘every man must be his
own assessor, in person or by deputy,’ without which his liberty
is entirely at the mercy of others. Here, again, in a different
form, is the original thunderbolt, ‘Taxation without representation
is tyranny;’ and the claim is made not merely for communities,
but for ‘every man.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>In a similar way wrote Benjamin Franklin, some six
years after, in that remarkable sheet found among his
papers, and called “Declaration of those Rights of the
Commonalty of Great Britain, without which they cannot
be free.” The leading propositions were these
three:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“That every man of the commonalty (excepting infants,
insane persons, and criminals) is of common right and by the
laws of God a freeman, and entitled to the free enjoyment of
liberty. That liberty, or freedom, consists in having an actual
share in the appointment of those who frame the laws, and
who are to be the guardians of every man’s life, property, and
peace; for the all of one man is as dear to him as the all of
another; and the poor man has an equal right, but more need,
to have representatives in the legislature than the rich one.
That they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives
do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved to
those who have votes, and to their representatives; for to be
enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>us, and be subject to laws made by the representatives of
others, without having had representatives of our own to give
consent in our behalf.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Sparks’s Franklin, ii. 372.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In quoting these words of Dr. Franklin, his latest
biographer feels moved to add, “These principles, so
familiar to us now and so obviously just, were startling
and incredible novelties in 1770, abhorrent to nearly all
Englishmen, and to great numbers of Americans.”
Their fair application is still abhorrent to a great many;
or else, not willing quite to deny the theory, they limit
the application by some such device as “virtual representation.”
Here, again, James Otis is ready for them;
and Charles Sumner is ready to quote Otis, as thus:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known
in law or constitution. It is altogether a subtlety and illusion,
wholly unfounded and absurd. We must not be cheated by
any such phantom, or any other fiction of law or politics, or
any monkish trick of deceit or blasphemy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>These are the sharp words used by the patriot Otis,
speaking of those who were trying to convince American
citizens that they were virtually represented in Parliament.
Sumner applied the same principle to the
freedmen: it is now applied to women. “Taxation
without representation is tyranny.” “Virtual representation
is altogether a subtlety and illusion, wholly
unfounded and absurd.” No ingenuity, no evasion,
can give any escape from these plain principles. Either
you must revoke the maxims of the American Revolution,
or you must enfranchise woman. Stuart Mill well
says in his autobiography, “The interest of woman is
included in that of man exactly as much (and no more)
as that of subjects in that of kings.”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>FOUNDED ON A ROCK.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Gov. Long’s letter on woman suffrage is of peculiar
value, as recalling us to the simple principles of
“right,” on which alone the agitation can be solidly
founded. The ground once taken by many, that women
as women would be sure to act on a far higher political
plane than men as men, is now urged less than formerly:
the very mistakes and excesses of the agitation
itself have partially disproved it. No cause can safely
sustain itself on the hypothesis that all its advocates
are saints and sages; but a cause that is based on a
principle rests on a rock.</p>

<p class='c014'>If there is any one who is recognized as a fair
exponent of our national principles, it is our martyr-president
Abraham Lincoln; whom Lowell calls, in his
noble Commemoration Ode at Cambridge,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“New birth of our new soil, the first American.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>What President Lincoln’s political principle was, we
know. On his journey to Washington for his first
inauguration, he said, “I have never had a feeling
that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in
the Declaration of Independence.” To find out what
was his view of those sentiments, we must go back
several years earlier, and consider that remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>letter of his to the Boston Republicans who had invited
him to join them in celebrating Jefferson’s birthday,
in April, 1859. It was well called by Charles Sumner
“a gem in political literature;” and it seems to me
almost as admirable, in its way, as the Gettysburg
address.</p>

<p class='c021'>“The principles of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms
of free society. And yet they are denied and evaded with no
small show of success. One dashingly calls them ‘glittering
generalities.’ Another bluntly styles them ‘self-evident lies.’
And others insidiously argue that they apply only to ‘superior
races.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>“These expressions, differing in form, are identical in object
and effect,—the subverting the principles of free government,
and restoring those of classification, caste, and legitimacy.
They would delight a convocation of crowned heads
plotting against the people. They are the vanguard, the sappers
and miners of returning despotism. We must repulse
them, or they will subjugate us.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“All honor to Jefferson!—the man who, in the concrete
pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single
people, had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to introduce
into a merely revolutionary document <em>an abstract truth applicable
to all men and all times</em>, and so to embalm it there that
to-day and in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and a
stumbling-block to the harbingers of re-appearing tyranny and
oppression.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The special “abstract truth” to which President
Lincoln thus attaches a value so great, and which he
pronounces “applicable to all men and all times,” is
evidently the assertion of the Declaration that governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed, following the assertion that all men are born
free and equal; that is, as some one has interpreted it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>equally men. I do not see how any person but a
dreamy recluse can deny that the strength of our
republic rests on these principles; which are so thoroughly
embedded in the average American mind that
they take in it, to some extent, the place occupied in
the average English mind by the emotion of personal
loyalty to a certain reigning family. But it is impossible
to defend these principles logically, as Senator
Hoar has well pointed out, without recognizing that
they are as applicable to women as to men. If this
is the case, the claim of women rests on a right,—indeed,
upon the same right which is the foundation
of all our institutions.</p>

<p class='c014'>The encouraging fact in the present condition of the
whole matter is, not that we get more votes here or
there for this or that form of woman suffrage—for experience
has shown that there are great ups and downs
in that respect; and States that at one time seemed
nearest to woman suffrage, as Maine and Kansas, now
seem quite apathetic. But the real encouragement is,
that the logical ground is more and more conceded; and
the point now usually made is, not that the Jeffersonian
maxim excludes women, but that “the consent of the
governed” is substantially given by the general consent
of women. That this argument has a certain plausibility,
may be conceded; but it is equally clear that the
minority of women, those who do wish to vote, includes
on the whole the natural leaders,—those who are foremost
in activity of mind, in literature, in art, in good
works of charity. It is, therefore, pretty sure that they
only predict the opinions of the rest, who will follow
them in time. And, even while waiting, it is a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>question whether the “governed” have not the right to
give their votes when they wish, even if the majority of
them prefer to stay away from the polls. We do not
repeal our naturalization laws, although only the minority
of our foreign-born inhabitants as yet take the
pains to become naturalized.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>“THE GOOD OF THE GOVERNED.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Paris, some years ago, I was for a time a resident
in a cultivated French family, where the father was
non-committal in politics, the mother and son were
republicans, and the daughter was a Bonapartist. Asking
the mother why the young lady thus held to a
different creed from the rest, I was told that she had
made up her mind that the streets of Paris were kept
cleaner under the empire than since its disappearance:
hence her imperialism.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have heard American men advocate the French
empire at home and abroad, without offering reasons
so good as those of the lively French maiden. But
I always think of her remark when the question is
seriously asked, as Mr. Parkman, for instance, gravely
puts it in his late rejoinder in “The North American
Review,”—“The real issue is this: Is the object of
government the good of the governed, or is it not?”
Taken in a general sense, there is probably no disposition
to discuss this conundrum, for the simple reason
that nobody dissents from it. But the important point
is: What does “the good of the governed” mean?
Does it merely mean better street-cleaning, or something
more essential?</p>

<p class='c014'>There is nothing new in the distinction. Ever since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>De Tocqueville wrote his “Democracy in America,”
forty years ago, this precise point has been under
active discussion. That acute writer himself recurs to
it again and again. Every government, he points out,
nominally seeks the good of the people, and rests on
their will at last. But there is this difference: A
monarchy organizes better, does its work better, cleans
the streets better. Nevertheless De Tocqueville, a monarchist,
sees this advantage in a republic, that when all
this is done by the people for themselves, although the
work done may be less perfect, yet the people themselves
are more enlightened, better satisfied, and, in the end,
their good is better served. Thus in one place he
quotes a “a writer of talent” who complains of the
want of administrative perfection in the United States,
and says, “We are indebted to centralization, that
admirable invention of a great man, for the uniform
order and method which prevails alike in all the municipal
budgets (of France) from the largest town to the
humblest commune.” But, says De Tocqueville,—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Whatever may be my admiration of this result, when I see
the communes (municipalities) of France, with their excellent
system of accounts, plunged in the grossest ignorance of their
true interests, and abandoned to so incorrigible an apathy that
they seem to vegetate rather than to live; when, on the other
hand, I observe the activity, the information, and the spirit of
enterprise which keeps society in perpetual labor, in these
American townships, whose budgets are drawn up with small
method and with still less uniformity,—I am struck by the
spectacle; <em>for, to my mind, the end of a good government is to
insure the welfare of a people</em>, and not to establish order and
regularity in the midst of its misery and its distress.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The Italics are my own; but it will be seen that he
uses a phrase almost identical with Mr. Parkman’s,
and that he uses it to show that there is something to
be looked at beyond good laws,—namely, the beneficial
effect of self-government. In another place he comes
back to the subject again:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“It is incontestable that the people frequently conducts
public business very ill; but it is impossible that the lower
order should take a part in public business without extending
the circle of their ideas, and without quitting the ordinary
routine of their mental acquirements; the humblest individual
who is called upon to co-operate in the government of society
acquires a certain degree of self-respect; and, as he possesses
authority, he can command the services of minds much more
enlightened than his own. He is canvassed by a multitude of
applicants, who seek to deceive him in a thousand different
ways, but who instruct him by their deceit.... Democracy
does not confer the most skilful kind of government upon the
people; but it produces that which the most skilful governments
are frequently unable to awaken, namely, an all-pervading
and restless activity, a superabundant force, and an
energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under
favorable circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits.
These are the true advantages of democracy.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. Ibid., vol. ii. pp. 74, 75.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>These passages and others like them are worth careful
study. They clearly point out the two different
standards by which we may criticise all political systems.
One class of thinkers, of whom Froude is the
most conspicuous, holds that the “good of the people”
means good laws and good administration, and that, if
these are only provided, it makes no sort of difference
whether they themselves make the laws, or whether
some Cæsar or Louis Napoleon provides them. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the traditions of the early and later Federalists point
this way. But it has always seemed to me a theory
of government essentially incompatible with American
institutions. If we could once get our people saturated
with it, they would soon be at the mercy of some Louis
Napoleon of their own.</p>

<p class='c014'>When President Lincoln claimed, following Theodore
Parker, that ours was not merely a government for the
people, but of the people and by the people as well, he
recognized the other side of the matter,—that it is not
only important what laws we have, but who makes the
laws; and that “the end of a good government is to
insure the welfare of a people,” in this far wider sense.
That advantage which the French writer admits in
democracy, that it develops force, energy, and self-respect,
is as essentially a part of “the good of the
governed,” as is any perfection in the details of government.
And it is precisely these advantages which we
expect that women, sooner or later, are to share. For
them, as for men, “the good of the governed” is not
genuine unless it is that kind of good which belongs
to the self-governed.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>RULING AT SECOND-HAND.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Women ruled all; and ministers of state</div>
      <div class='line'>Were at the doors of women forced to wait,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Women, who’ve oft as sovereigns graced the land,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never governed well at second-hand.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>So wrote in the last century the bitter satirist Charles
Churchill, and this verse will do something to keep alive
his name. He touches the very kernel of the matter,
and all history is on his side. The Salic Law excluded
women from the throne of France,—“the kingdom of
France being too noble to be governed by a woman,”
as it said. Accordingly the history of France shows
one long line of royal mistresses ruling in secret for
mischief; while more liberal England points to the
reigns of Elizabeth and Anne and Victoria, to show
how usefully a woman may sit upon a throne.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was one of the merits of Margaret Fuller Ossoli,
that she always pointed out this distinction. “Any
woman can have influence,” she said, “in some way.
She need only to be a good cook or a good scold, to
secure that. Woman should not merely have a share
in the power of man,—for of that omnipotent Nature
will not suffer her to be defrauded,—but it should be a
<em>chartered</em> power, too fully recognized to be abused.”
We have got to meet, at any rate, this fact of feminine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>influence in the world. Demosthenes said that the
measures which a statesman had meditated for a year
might be overturned in a day by a woman. How infinitely
more sensible, then, to train the woman herself in
statesmanship, and give her open responsibility as well
as concealed power!</p>

<p class='c014'>The same principle of demoralizing subordination
runs through the whole position of women. Many a husband
makes of his wife a doll, dresses her in fine clothes,
gives or withholds money according to his whims, and
laughs or frowns if she asks any questions about his
business. If only a petted slave, she naturally develops
the vices of a slave; and when she wants more money
for more fine clothes, and finds her husband out of
humor, she coaxes, cheats, and lies. Many a woman
half ruins her husband by her extravagance, simply
because he has never told her frankly what his income
is, or treated her, in money matters, like a rational being.
Bankruptcy, perhaps, brings both to their senses; and
thenceforward the husband discovers that his wife is a
woman, not a child. But, for want of this, whole families
and generations of women are trained to deception.
I knew an instance where a fashionable dressmaker in
New York urged an economical young girl, about to
be married, to buy of her a costly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</span></i> or wedding
outfit. “But I have not the money,” said the maiden.
“No matter,” said the complaisant tempter: “I will
wait four years, and send in the bill to your husband
by degrees. Many ladies do it.” Fancy the position of
a pure young girl, wishing innocently to make herself
beautiful in the eyes of her husband, and persuaded to
go into his house with a trick like this upon her conscience!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Yet it grows directly out of the whole theory
of life which is preached to many women,—that all
they seek must be won by indirect manœuvres, and not
by straightforward living.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a mistaken system. Once recognize woman as
born to be the equal, not inferior, of man, and she accepts
as a right her share of the family income, of
political power, and of all else that is capable of distribution.
As it is, we are in danger of forgetting that
woman, in mind as in body, was born to be upright.
The women of Charles Reade—never by any possibility
moving in a straight line where it is possible to find a
crooked one—are distorted women; and Nature is no
more responsible for them than for the figures produced
by tight lacing and by high-heeled boots. These physical
deformities acquire a charm, when the taste adjusts
itself to them; and so do those pretty tricks and those
interminable lies. But after all, to make a noble woman,
you must give a noble training.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>“TOO MANY VOTERS ALREADY.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Curiously enough, the commonest argument against
woman suffrage does not now take the form of an
attack on women, but on men. Formerly we were told
that women, as women, were incapable of voting; that
they had not, as old Theophilus Parsons wrote in
1780, “a sufficient acquired discretion;” or that they
had not physical strength enough; or that they were
too delicate and angelic to vote. Now these remarks
are waived, and the argument is: Women are certainly
unfit for suffrage, since even men are unfit. It is
something to have women at last recognized as politically
equal to men, even if it be only in the fact of
unfitness.</p>

<p class='c014'>A spasm of re-action is just now passing over the
minds of many men, especially among educated Americans,
against universal suffrage. Possibly it is a re-action
from that too great confidence in mere numbers
which at one time prevailed. All human governments
are as yet very imperfect; and, unless we view them
reasonably, they are all worthless. We try them by
unjust or whimsical tests. I do not see that anybody
who objects to universal suffrage has any working
theory to suggest as a substitute: the only plan he even
implies is usually that he himself and his friends, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>those whom he thinks worthy, should make the laws, or
decide who should make them. From this I should
utterly dissent: I should far rather be governed by the
community, as a whole, than by my ablest friend and
his ablest friends; for, if the whole community governs,
I know it will not govern very much, and that the
tendency will be towards personal freedom by common
consent. But if my particular friend once begins to
govern me, or I him, the love of power would be in
danger of growing very much. It may be that he
could be safely trusted with such authority, but I am
very sure that I could not.</p>

<p class='c014'>We shall never get much beyond that pithy question
of Jefferson’s, “It is said that man cannot govern
himself: how, then, can he govern another?” There is
absolutely no test by which we can determine, on any
large scale, who are fit to exercise suffrage, and who
are not. John Brown would exclude John Smith; and
John Smith would wish to keep out John Brown, especially
if he had inconvenient views, like him of Harper’s
Ferry. The safeguard of scientific legislation may be
in the heads of a cultivated few, but the safeguard of
personal freedom is commonly in the hands of the
uncultivated many. The most moderate republican
thinker might find himself under the supervision of
Bismarck’s police at any moment, should he visit
Berlin; and how easily he might himself fall into the
Bismarck way of thinking, is apparent when we consider
that the excellent Dr. Joseph P. Thompson,
writing from Germany, is understood gravely to recommend
the exclusion of German communists from the
ports of the United States. When we consider how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>easily the first principles of liberty might thus be sacrificed
by the wise few, let us be grateful that we are
protected by the presence of the multitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whenever the vote goes against us, we are apt to
think that there must be something wrong in the moral
nature of the voters. It would be better to see if their
votes cannot teach us something,—if the fact of our
defeat does not show that we left out something,
or failed to see some fact which our opponents saw.
There could not be a plainer case of this than in recent
Massachusetts elections. Many good men regarded
it as a hopeless proof of ignorance or depravity in the
masses, that more than a hundred thousand voters sustained
General Butler for governor. For one, I regard
that candidate as a demagogue, no doubt; but can
anybody in Massachusetts now help seeing that the
instinct which led that large mass of men to his support
was in great measure a true one? Every act of
the Republican legislatures since assembled has been
influenced by that vague protest in behalf of State
reform and economy which General Butler represented.
He complicated it with other issues, very likely, and
swelled the number of his supporters by unscrupulous
means. It may have been very fortunate that
he did not succeed; but it is fortunate that he tried,
and that he found supporters. In this remarkable
instance we see how the very dangers and excesses of
popular suffrage work for good.</p>

<p class='c014'>For myself, I do not see how we can have too many
voters. I am very sure, that, in the long-run, voting
tends to educate and enlighten men, to make them
more accessible to able leadership, to give them a feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of personal self-respect and independence. This
is true not merely of Americans and Protestants, but
of the foreign-born and the Roman Catholic; since
experience shows that the political control and interference
of the priesthood are exceedingly over-rated.
I believe that the poor and the ignorant eminently
need the ballot, first for self-respect, and then for self-protection;
and, if so, why do not women need it for
precisely the same reasons?</p>

<p class='c013'>“No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known
in law or constitution. It is altogether a subtlety and illusion,
wholly unfounded and absurd. We must not be cheated by
any such phantom or any other trick of law and politics.”—<span class='sc'>James

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXX.<br /> <span class='large'>DRAWING THE LINE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When in Dickens’s “Nicholas Nickleby” the coal-heaver
calls at the fashionable barber’s to be shaved,
the barber declines that service. The coal-heaver
pleads that he saw a baker being shaved there the day
before. But the barber points out to him that it is
necessary to draw the line somewhere, and he draws
it at bakers.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is, doubtless, an inconvenience, in respect to
woman suffrage, that so many people have their own
theories as to drawing the line, and deciding who shall
vote. Each has his hobby; and as the opportunity for
applying it to men has passed by, each wishes to catch
at the last remaining chance, and apply it to women.
One believes in drawing an educational line; another,
in a property qualification; another, in new restrictions
on naturalization; another, in distinctions of race; and
each wishes to keep women, for a time, as the only
remaining victims for his experiment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fortunately the answer to all these objections, on
behalf of woman suffrage, is very brief and simple.
It is no more the business of its advocates to decide
upon the best abstract basis for suffrage, than it is to
decide upon the best system of education, or of labor,
or of marriage. Its business is to equalize, in all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>directions; nothing more. When that is done, there
will be plenty still left to do, without doubt; but it will
not involve the rights of women, as such. Simply to
strike out the word “male” from the statute,—that is
our present work. “What is sauce for the goose”—but
the proverb is somewhat musty. These educational
and property restrictions may be of value; but,
wherever they are already removed from the men, they
must be removed from women also. Enfranchise them
equally, and then begin afresh, if you please, to legislate
for the whole human race. What we protest
against is that you should have let down the bars for
one sex, and should at once become conscientiously
convinced that they should be put up again for the
other.</p>

<p class='c014'>When it was, proposed to apply an educational qualification
at the South after the war, the Southern white
loyalists all objected to it. If you make it universal,
they said, it cuts off many of the whites. If you apply
it to the blacks alone, it is manifestly unjust. The case
is the same with women in regard to men. As woman
needs the ballot primarily to protect herself, it is manifestly
unjust to restrict the suffrage for her, when man
has it without restriction. If she needs protection,
then she needs it all the more from being poor, or
ignorant, or Irish, or black. If we do not see this, the
freedwomen of the South did. There is nothing like
personal wrong to teach people logic.</p>

<p class='c014'>We hear a great deal said in dismay, and sometimes
even by old abolitionists, about “increasing the number
of ignorant voters.” In Massachusetts, there is an
educational restriction for men, such as it is; in Rhode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Island, a property qualification is required for voting
on certain questions. Personally, I believe with “Warrington,”
that, if ignorant voting be bad, ignorant nonvoting
is worse; and that the enfranchised “masses,”
which have a legitimate outlet for their political opinions,
are far less dangerous than disfranchised masses,
which must rely on mobs and strikes. I will go farther,
and say that I believe our Republic is, on the whole, in
less danger from its poor men, who have got to stay in
it and bring up their children, than from its rich men,
who have always Paris and Dresden to fall back upon.
As to a property qualification, there is no dispute that
Rhode Island—the only New England State which has
one—is the only State where votes are publicly bought
and sold on any large scale. I do not see that even a
poll-tax or registry-tax is of any use as a safeguard;
for, if men are to be bought, the tax merely offers a
more indirect and palatable form in which to pay the
price. Many a man consents to have his poll-tax paid
by his party or his candidate, when he would reject the
direct offer of a dollar-bill.</p>

<p class='c014'>But this is all private speculation, and has nothing to
do with the woman suffrage movement. All that we can
ask, as advocates of this reform, is, that the inclusion
or the exclusion should be the same for both sexes.
We cannot put off the equality of woman till that
time, a few centuries hence, when the Social Science
Association shall have-succeeded in agreeing on the
true basis of “scientific legislation.” It is as if we
urged that wives should share their husbands’ dinners,
and were told that the physicians had not decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>whether beefsteak were wholesome. The answer is,
“Beefsteak or tripe, yeast or saleratus, which you
please. But, meanwhile, what is good enough for the
wife is good enough for the husband.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXI.<br /> <span class='large'>FOR SELF-PROTECTION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I remember to have read, many years ago, the life
of Sir Samuel Romilly, the English philanthropist. He
was the author of more beneficent legal reforms than
any man of his day, and there was in this book a long
list of the changes he still meant to bring about. It
struck me very much, that, among these proposed reforms,
not one of any importance referred to the laws
about women.</p>

<p class='c014'>It shows—what all experience has shown—that no
class or race or sex can safely trust its protection in
any hands but its own. The laws of England in regard
to woman were then so bad that Lord Brougham afterwards
said they needed total reconstruction, if they
were to be touched at all. And yet it is only since
woman suffrage began to be talked about, that the
work of law-reform has really taken firm hold. In
many cases in America the beneficent measures are directly
to be traced to some appeal from feminine advocates.
Even in Canada, as stated the other day by Dr.
Cameron, formerly of Toronto, the bill protecting the
property of married women was passed under the immediate
pressure of Lucy Stone’s eloquence. And, even
where this direct agency could not be traced, the general
fact that the atmosphere was full of the agitation had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>much to do with all the reforms that took place. Legislatures,
unwilling to give woman the ballot, were shamed
into giving her something. The chairman of the judiciary
committee in Rhode Island told me, that, until he
heard women address the committee, he had not reflected
upon their legal disabilities, or thought how unjust these
were. While the matter was left to the other sex only,
even men like Sir Samuel Romilly forgot the wrongs of
woman. When she began to advocate her own cause
men also waked up.</p>

<p class='c014'>But now that they are awake, they ask, is not this
sufficient? Not at all. If an agent who has cheated
you surrenders reluctantly one-half your stolen goods,
you do not stop there and say, “It is enough. Your
intention is honorable. Please continue my agent with
increased pay.” On the contrary, you say, “Your
admission of wrong is a plea of guilty. Give me the
rest of what is mine.” There is no defence like self-defence,
no protection like self-protection.</p>

<p class='c014'>All theories of chivalry and generosity and vicarious
representation fall before the fact that woman has been
grossly wronged by man. That being the case, the
only modest and honest thing for man to do is to say,
“Henceforward have a voice in making your own
laws.” Till this is done, she has no sure safeguard,
since otherwise the same men who made the old barbarous
laws may at any time restore them.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is common to say that woman suffrage will make
no great difference; for that women will think very much
as men do, and it will simply double the vote without
varying the result. About many matters this may be
true. To be sure, it is probable that on questions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>conscience, like slavery and temperance, the woman’s
vote would by no means coincide with man’s. But
grant that it would. The fact remains,—and all history
shows it,—that on all that concerns her own protection
a woman needs her own vote. Would a woman vote
to give her husband the power of bequeathing her
children to the control and guardianship of somebody
else? Would a woman vote to sustain the law by which
a Massachusetts chief justice bade the police take those
crying children from their mother’s side in the Boston
court-room a few years ago, and hand them over to a
comparative stranger, because that mother had married
again? You might as well ask whether the colored
vote would sustain the Dred Scott decision. Tariffs or
banks may come or go the same, whether the voters be
white or black, male or female. But, when the wrongs
of an oppressed class or sex are to be righted, the ballot
is the only guaranty. After they have gained a
potential voice for themselves, the Sir Samuel Romillys
will remember them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXII.<br /> <span class='large'>WOMANLY STATESMANSHIP.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The newspapers periodically express a desire to know
whether women have given evidence, on the whole, of
superior statesmanship to men. There are constant
requests that they will define their position as to the
tariff and the fisheries and the civil-service question.
If they do not speak, it is naturally assumed that they
will forever after hold their peace. Let us see how
that matter stands.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that the greatest mechanical skill in America
is to be found among professional burglars who come
here from England. Suppose one of these men were
in prison, and we were to stand outside and taunt him
through the window: “Here is a locomotive engine:
why do you not mend or manage it? Here is a steam
printing-press: if you know any thing, set it up for me!
You a mechanic, when you have not proved that you
understand any of these things? Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c014'>But Jack Sheppard, if he condescended to answer us
at all, would coolly say, “Wait a while, till I have
finished my present job. Being in prison, my first
business is to get out of prison. Wait till I have
picked this lock, and mined this wall; wait till I have
made a saw out of a watch-spring, and a ladder out of
a pair of blankets. Let me do my first task, and get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>out of limbo, and then see if your little printing-presses
and locomotives are too puzzling for my fingers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Politically speaking, woman is in prison, and her
first act of skill must be in getting through the wall.
For her there is no tariff question, no question of the
fisheries. She will come to that by and by, if you
please; but for the present her statesmanship must be
employed nearer home. The “civil-service reform”
in which she is most concerned is a reform which shall
bring her in contact with the civil service. Her political
creed, for the present, is limited to that of Sterne’s
starling in the cage,—“I can’t get out.” If she is
supposed to have any common-sense at all, she will
best show it by beginning at the point where she is,
instead of at the point where somebody else is. She
would indeed be as foolish as these editors think her
if she now spent her brains upon the tariff question,
which she cannot reach, instead of upon her own enfranchisement
which she is fast reaching.</p>

<p class='c014'>The woman suffrage movement in America, in all its
stages and subdivisions, has been the work of woman.
No doubt men have helped in it: much of the talking
has been done by them, and they have furnished many
of the printed documents. But the energy, the methods,
the unwearied purpose, of the movement, have come
from women: they have led in all councils; they have
established the newspapers, got up the conventions,
addressed the legislatures, and raised the money.
Thirty years have shown, with whatever temporary
variations, one vast wave of progress toward success,
both in this country and in Europe. Now, success is
statesmanship.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>I remember well the shouts of laughter that used to
greet the anti-slavery orators when they claimed that
the real statesmen of the country were not the Calhouns
and Websters, who spent their strength in trying to
sustain slavery, and failed, but the Garrisons, who devoted
their lives to its overthrow, and were succeeding.
Yet who now doubts this? Tried by the same standard,
the statesmanship of to-day does not lie in the
men who can find no larger questions before them than
those which concern the fisheries, but in the women
whose far-reaching efforts will one day make every existing
voting-list so much waste paper.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, when the voting-lists with the women’s
names are ready to be printed, it will be interesting to
speculate as to how these new monarchs of our destiny
will use their power. For myself, a long course of observation
in the anti-slavery and woman suffrage movements
has satisfied me that women are not idiots, and
that, on the whole, when they give their minds to a
question, whether moral or practical, they understand
it quite as readily as men. In the anti-slavery movement
it is certain that a woman, Elizabeth Heyrick,
gave the first impulse to its direct and simple solution
in England; and that another woman, Mrs. Stowe, did
more than any man, except perhaps Garrison and John
Brown, to secure its right solution here. There was
never a moment, I am confident, when any great political
question growing out of the anti-slavery struggle
might not have been put to vote more safely among
the women of New England than among the clergy, or
the lawyers, or the college-professors. If they have
done so well in the last great issue, it is fair to assume,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>that, after they have a sufficient inducement to study
out future issues, they at least will not be very much
behind the men.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we cannot keep it too clearly in view, that the
whole question, whether women would vote better or
worse than men on general questions, is a minor matter.
It was equally a minor matter in case of the negroes.
We gave the negroes the ballot, simply because they
needed it for their own protection; and we shall by and
by give it to women for the same reason. Tried by
that test, we shall find that their statesmanship will be
genuine. When they come into power, drunken husbands
will no longer control their wives’ earnings, and a
chief justice will no longer order a child to be removed
from its mother, amid its tears and outcries, merely
because that mother has married again. And if, as we
are constantly assured, woman’s first duty is to her
home and her children, she may count it a good beginning
in statesmanship to secure to herself the means of
protecting both. That once settled, it will be time
enough to “interview” her in respect to the proper
rate of duty on pig-iron.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>TOO MUCH PREDICTION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Seek not to proticipate,” says Mrs. Gamp, the
venerable nurse in “Martin Chuzzlewit”—“but take
’em as they come, and as they go.” I am persuaded
that our woman-suffrage arguments would be improved
by this sage counsel, and that at present we indulge in
too many bold anticipations.</p>

<p class='c014'>Is there not altogether too much tendency to predict
what women will do when they vote? Could that
good time come to-morrow, we should be startled to
find to how many different opinions and “causes” the
new voters were already pledged. One speaker wishes
that women should be emancipated, because of the
fidelity with which they are sure to support certain
desirable measures, as peace, order, freedom, temperance,
righteousness, and judgment to come. Then
the next speaker has his or her schedule of political
virtues, and is equally confident that women, if once
enfranchised, will guarantee clear majorities for them
all. The trouble is, that we thus mortgage this new
party of the future, past relief, beyond possibility of
payment, and incur the ridicule of the unsanctified by
committing our cause to a great many contradictory
pledges.</p>

<p class='c014'>I know an able and high-minded woman of foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>birth, who courageously, but as I think mistakenly,
calls herself an atheist, and who has for years advocated
woman-suffrage as the only antidote to the rule of
the clergy. On the other hand, an able speaker in the
late Boston convention advocated the same thing as
the best way of defeating atheism, and securing the
positive assertion of religion by the community. Both
cannot be correct: neither is entitled to speak for
woman. That being the case, would it not be better
to keep clear of this dangerous ground of prediction,
and keep to the argument based on rights and needs?
If our theory of government be worth any thing,
woman has the same right to the ballot that man has:
she certainly needs it as much for self-defence. How
she will use it, when she gets it, is her own affair. It
may be that she will use it more wisely than her brothers;
but I am satisfied to believe that she will use it as
well. Let us not attribute infallible wisdom and virtue,
even to women; for, as dear Mrs. Poyser says in
Adam Bede, “God Almighty made some of ’em foolish,
to match the men.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is common to assume, for instance, that all women
by nature favor peace; and that, even if they do not
always seem to promote it in their social walk and conversation,
they certainly will in their political. When
we consider how all the pleasing excitements, achievements,
and glories of war, such as they are, accrue to
men only, and how large a part of the miseries are
brought home to women, it might seem that their vote
on this matter, at least, would be a sure thing. Thus
far the theory: the fact being that we have but just
emerged from a civil war which convulsed the nation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and cost half a million lives; and which was, from the
very beginning, fomented, stimulated, and applauded,
at least on one side, by the united voice of the women.
It will be generally admitted by those who know, that,
but for the women of the seceding States, the war of
the Rebellion would have been waged more feebly, been
sooner ended, and far more easily forgotten. Nay, I
was told a few days since by an able Southern lawyer,
who was long the mayor of one of the largest Southern
cities, that in his opinion the practice of duelling—which
is an epitome of war—owes its continued existence
at the South to a sustaining public sentiment
among the women.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, where the sympathy of women is wholly on
the side of right, it is by no means safe to assume that
their mode of enforcing that sentiment will be equally
judicious. Take, for instance, the temperance cause.
It is usual to assume that women are a unit on that
question. When we look at the two extremes of
society,—the fine lady pressing wine upon her New
Year’s visitors, and the Irishwoman laying in a family
supply of whiskey to last over Sunday,—the assumption
seems hasty. But grant it. Is it equally sure,
that when woman takes hold of that most difficult of all
legislation, the license and prohibitory laws, she will
handle them more wisely than men have done? Will
her more ardent zeal solve the problem on which so much
zeal has already been lavished in vain? In large cities,
for instance, where there is already more law than can
be enforced, will her additional ballots afford the means
to enforce it? It may be so; but it seems wiser not
to predict nor to anticipate, but to wait and hope.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>It is no reproach on woman to say that she is not infallible
on particular questions. There is much reason
to suppose that in politics, as in every other sphere, the
joint action of the sexes will be better and wiser than
that of either singly. It seems obvious that the experiment
of republican government will be more fairly
tried when one-half the race is no longer disfranchised.
It is quite certain, at any rate, that no class can trust
its rights to the mercy and chivalry of any other, but
that, the weaker it is, the more it needs all political
aids and securities for self-protection. Thus far, we
are on safe ground; and here, as it seems to me, the
claim for suffrage may securely rest. To go farther in
our assertions, seems to me unsafe, although many
of our wisest and most eloquent may differ from me;
and, the nearer we approach success, the more important
it is to look to our weapons. It is a plausible and
tempting argument, to claim suffrage for woman on
the ground that she is an angel; but I think it will
prove wiser, in the end, to claim it for her as being
human.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In a hotly contested municipal election, the other
day, an active political manager was telling me his tactics.
“We have to send carriages for some of the
voters,” he said. “First-class carriages! If we
undertake to wait on ’em, we must do it in good shape,
and not leave the best carriages to be hired by the
other party.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I am not much given to predicting just what will
happen when women vote; but I confidently assert
that they will be taken to the polls, if they wish, in
first-class carriages. If the best horses are to be harnessed,
and the best cushions selected, and every panel
of the coach rubbed till you can see your face in it,
merely to accommodate some elderly man who lives
two blocks away, and could walk to the polls very
easily, then how much more will these luxuries be
placed at the service of every woman, young or old,
whose presence at the polls is made doubtful by mud,
or snow, or the prospect of a shower!</p>

<p class='c014'>But the carriage is only the beginning of the polite
attentions that will soon appear. When we see the
transformation undergone by every ferry-boat and
every railway-station, so soon as it comes to be frequented
by women, who can doubt that voting-places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>will experience the same change? They will soon
have—at least in the “ladies’ department,”—elegance
instead of discomfort, beauty for ashes, plenty
of rocking-chairs, and no need of spittoons.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Very
possibly they may have all the modern conveniences
and inconveniences,—furnace-registers, tea-kettles,
Washington-pies, and a young lady to give checks for
bundles. Who knows what elaborate comforts, what
queenly luxuries, may be offered to women at voting-places,
when the time has finally arrived to sue for
their votes?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. Since this was written, the legislature of Massachusetts has passed,
with little opposition, a law prohibiting smoking at voting-places,—an
explicit fulfilment of this prophecy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The common impression has always been quite different
from this. People look at the coarseness and
dirt now visible at so many voting-places, and say,
“Would you expose women to all that?” But these
places are not dirtier than a railway smoking-car; and
there is no more coarseness than in any ferry-boat
which is, for whatever reason, used by men only.
You do not look into those places, and say with indignation,
“Never, if I can help it, shall my wife or my
beloved great-grandmother travel by steamboat or by
rail!” You know that with these exemplary relatives
will enter order and quiet, carpets and curtains, brooms
and dusters. Why should it be otherwise with wardrooms
and town-halls?</p>

<p class='c014'>There is not an atom more of intrinsic difficulty in
providing a decorous ladies’ room for a voting-place,
than for a post-office or a railway-station; and it is as
simple a thing to vote a ticket as to buy one. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>being thus easily practicable, all men will desire to provide
it. And the example of the first-class carriages
shows that the parties will vie with each other in these
pleasing arrangements. They will be driven to it,
whether they wish it or not. The party which has
most consistently and resolutely kept woman away
from the ballot-box will be the very party compelled,
for the sake of self-preservation, to make her “rights”
agreeable to her when once she gets them. A few
stupid or noisy men may indeed try to make the polls
unattractive to her, the very first time; but the result
of this little experiment will be so disastrous that the
offenders will be sternly suppressed by their own party-leaders,
before another election-day comes. It will
soon become clear, that, of all possible ways of losing
votes, the surest lies in treating women rudely.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lucy Stone tells a story of a good man in Kansas,
who, having done all he could to prevent women from
being allowed to vote on school questions, was finally
comforted, when that measure passed, by the thought
that he should at least secure his wife’s vote for a pet
schoolhouse of his own. Election-day came, and the
newly enfranchised matron showed the most culpable
indifference to her privileges. She made breakfast as
usual, went about her housework, and did on that perilous
day precisely the things that her anxious husband
had always predicted that women never would do
under such circumstances. His hints and advice found
no response; and nothing short of the best pair of
horses and the best wagon finally sufficed to take the
farmer’s wife to the polls. I am not the least afraid
that women will find voting a rude or disagreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>arrangement. There is more danger of their being
treated too well, and being too much attacked and allured
by these cheap cajoleries. But women are pretty
shrewd, and can probably be trusted to go to the polls,
even in first-class carriages.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXV.<br /> <span class='large'>EDUCATION <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i> SUFFRAGE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I know a rich bachelor of large property, who fatigues
his friends by perpetual denunciations of every
thing American, and especially of universal suffrage.
He rarely votes; and I was much amazed, when the
popular vote was to be taken on building an expensive
schoolhouse, to see him go to the polls, and vote in the
affirmative. On being asked his reason, he explained,
that, while we labored under the calamity of universal
(male) suffrage, he thought it best to mitigate its evils
by educating the voters. In short, he wished, as Mr.
Lowe said in England when the last Reform Bill
passed, “to prevail upon our future masters to learn
their alphabets.”</p>

<p class='c014'>These motives may not be generous; but the schoolhouses,
when they are built, are just as useful. Even
girls get the benefit of them, though the long delay in
many places before girls got their share came in part
from the want of this obvious stimulus. It is universal
male suffrage that guarantees schoolhouse and
school. The most selfish man understands that argument:
“We must educate the masses, if it is only to
keep them from our throats.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But there is a wider way in which suffrage guarantees
education. At every election-time, political information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>is poured upon the whole voting community, till it
is deluged. Presses run night and day to print newspaper
extras; clerks sit up all night to frank congressional
speeches; the most eloquent men in the
community expound the most difficult matters to the
ignorant. Of course each party affords only its own
point of view; but every man has a neighbor who is
put under treatment by some other party, and who is
constantly attacking all who will listen to his provoking
and pestilent counter-statements. All the common-school
education of the United States does not equal
the education of election-day; and, as in some States
elections are held very often, this popular university
seems to be kept in session almost the whole year
round. The consequence is a remarkable average popular
knowledge of political affairs,—a training which
American women now miss, but which will come to
them with the ballot.</p>

<p class='c014'>And in still another way, there will be an education
coming to woman from the right of suffrage. It will
come from her own sex, proceeding from highest to
lowest. We often hear it said, that, after enfranchisement,
the more educated women will not vote, while
the ignorant will. But Mrs. Howe admirably pointed
out, at a Philadelphia convention, that, the moment
women have the ballot, it will become the pressing
duty of the more educated women, even in self-protection,
to train the rest. The very fact of the danger
will be a stimulus to duty, with women, as it already is
with men.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has always seemed to me rather childish, in a man
of superior education, or talent, or wealth, to complain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>that when election-day comes he has no more votes
than the man who plants his potatoes or puts in his
coal. The truth is, that under the most thorough
system of universal suffrage the man of wealth or
talent or natural leadership has still a disproportionate
influence, still casts a hundred votes where the poor
or ignorant or feeble man throws but one. Even the
outrages of New York elections turned out to be caused
by the fact that the leading rogues had used their
brains and energy, while the men of character had not.
When it came to the point, it was found that a few
caricatures by Nast and a few columns of figures in
the Times were more than a match for all the repeaters
of the ring. It is always so. Andrew Johnson, with
all the patronage of the nation, had not the influence
of “Nasby” with his one newspaper. The whole
Chinese question was perceptibly and instantly modified
when Harte wrote “The Heathen Chinee.”</p>

<p class='c014'>These things being so, it indicates feebleness or
dyspepsia when an educated man is heard whining,
about election-time, with his fears of ignorant voting.
It is his business to enlighten and control that ignorance.
With a voice and a pen at his command, with
a town-hall in every town for the one, and a newspaper
in every village for the other, he has such advantages
over his ignorant neighbors that the only doubt is
whether his privileges are not greater than he deserves.
For one, in writing for the press, I am impressed by
the undue greatness, not by the littleness, of the power
I wield. And what is true of men will be true of
women. If the educated women of America have not
brains or energy enough to control, in the long-run,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the votes of the ignorant women around them, they
will deserve a severe lesson, and will be sure, like the
men in New York, to receive it. And thenceforward
they will educate and guide that ignorance, instead of
evading or cringing before it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But I have no fear about the matter. It is a libel
on American women to say that they will not go anywhere
or do any thing which is for the good of their
children and their husbands. Travel West on any of
our great lines of railroad, and see what women undergo
in transporting their households to their new homes.
See the watching and the feeding, and the endless answers
to the endless questions, and the toil to keep
little Sarah warm, and little Johnny cool, and the baby
comfortable. What a hungry, tired, jaded, forlorn
mass of humanity it is, as the sun rises on it each
morning, in the soiled and breathless railway-car! Yet
that household group is America in the making; those
are the future kings and queens, the little princes and
princesses, of this land. Now, is the mother who has
undergone for the transportation of these children all
this enormous labor, to shrink at her journey’s end
from the slight additional labor of going to the polls to
vote whether those little ones shall have schools or
rumshops? The thought is an absurdity. A few fine
ladies in cities will fear to spoil their silk dresses, as a
few foppish gentlemen now fear for their broadcloth.
But the mass of intelligent American women will vote,
as do the mass of men.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXVI.<br /> <span class='large'>“OFF WITH HER HEAD!”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” the Queen
of Hearts settles all disputes at croquet by ordering
somebody’s head to be taken off. It is the old royal
remedy. The Roman Tarquin, when his son sent to ask
him the best way of reducing a discontented city, merely
slashed off the heads of the tallest poppies, as he walked
in the garden. The young man took the hint, and performed
a similar process upon the leading citizens.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every year makes it plainer that the community must
imitate Tarquinius Superbus and the Queen of Hearts
if it wishes to get rid of the woman suffrage movement.
So long as every woman favors it whenever she gets
her head above a certain point, so long those conspicuous
heads must be recognized. You must either put
them on the voting-list, or on the list ordered for immediate
execution: there is no middle ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are the women who write books, for instance.
When authorship first came up among the women of
America, they not only claimed nothing more than the
mere privilege of having brains, but they almost apologized
for that. Their early authors, as Mrs. Child
and Mrs. Leslie, had a way of preparing a cookery-book
apiece, as a propitiation to the tyrant man, before
proceeding to what is called “the intellectual feast.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>They held, with Miss Bremer, that you can get any
thing you like from a man if you will only have something
nice to pop into his mouth. Mrs. Sarah J. Hale,
in her “Woman’s Record,” published twenty years ago,
adopted a different form of submission. She seemed
very anxious to prove that women had taken a prominent
part in the world; but also to show, that, if they
were only forgiven for this, they would never, never,
never make themselves any more prominent. It is but
within a few years that literary women have dared to go
beyond literature, and ask for a vote besides.</p>

<p class='c014'>But now, with what a terrible confidence they come to
the demand for suffrage when they acquire voice enough
to make themselves heard! Mrs. Stowe helps to free
Uncle Tom in his cabin, and then strikes for the freedom
of women in her own “Hearth and Home.” Mrs.
Howe writes the “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and
keeps on writing more battle-hymns in behalf of her
own sex. Miss Alcott not only delineates “Little
Women,” but wishes to emancipate them. Miss Phelps
desires to see the “Gates Ajar” for her sex, both in
heaven and on earth. Mrs. Child, who risked her
literary popularity in early life by her “Appeal for that
Class of Americans called Africans,” was as ready to
risk it again for that class of Americans called women.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, there are social circles in America where
all desire for leadership on the part of literary women
would be repudiated; nay, where the fact that a
woman had written a book would imply a loss of caste.
When Karl von Beethoven signed himself “<em>Gutsbesitzer</em>,”
or “land proprietor,” his brother Ludwig signed
himself “<em>Hirnbesitzer</em>,” or “proprietor of a brain.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Posterity remembers only the great musical composer;
yet, doubtless, to the society of that period, the stupid
elder brother was by far the greater man. Such perversities
cannot be helped; but I write for reasonable
people. Among the women who dance the German,
woman suffrage may be just now unpopular; but the
women who translate German will in the long-run have
most influence, and their verdict seems to tend the
other way. It is said that the leading dancer among
the young men of one of our cities was transformed
into an equally prominent lawyer by a single suggestion
from an elder sister, that it was “better to be a man of
books than a man of toes.” It is likely that America
will be more influenced at last by the women of heads
than by the women of heels.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXVII.<br /> <span class='large'>FOLLOW YOUR LEADERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“There go thirty thousand men,” shouted the Portuguese,
as Wellington, with a few staff-officers, rode
along the mountain-side. The action of the leaders’
minds, in any direction, has a value out of all proportion
to their numbers. In a campaign, there is a council
of officers,—Grant and Sherman and Sheridan perhaps.
They are but a trifling minority, yet what they
plan the whole army will do; and such is the faith in
a real leader, that, were all the restraints of discipline
for the moment relaxed, the rank and file would still
follow his judgment. What a few general officers see
to be the best to-day, the sergeants and corporals and
private soldiers will usually see to be best to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>In peace, also, there is a silent leadership; only
that in peace, as there is more time to spare, the
leaders are expected to persuade the rank and file,
instead of commanding them. Yet it comes to the
same thing in the end. The movement begins with
certain guides, and, if you wish to know the future,
keep your eye on them. If you wish to know what is
already decided, ask the majority; but, if you wish to
find out what is likely to be done next, ask the leaders.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is constantly said that the majority of women do
not yet desire to vote, and it is true. But, to find out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>whether they are likely to wish for it, we must keep
our eyes on the women who lead their sex. The representative
women,—those who naturally stand for the
rest, those most eminent for knowledge and self-devotion,—how
do they view the thing? The rank and file
do not yet demand the ballot, you say; but how is it
with the general officers?</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, it is a remarkable fact, about which those who
have watched this movement for twenty years can
hardly be mistaken, that almost any woman who
reaches a certain point of intellectual or moral development
will presently be found desiring the ballot for her
sex. If this be so, it predicts the future. It is the
judgment of Grant and Sherman and Sheridan as
against that of the average private soldier of the Two
Hundredth Infantry. Set aside, if you please, the specialists
of this particular agitation,—those who were
first known to the public through its advocacy. There
is no just reason why they should be set aside, yet concede
that for a moment. The fact remains that the
ablest women in the land—those who were recognized
as ablest in other spheres, before they took this particular
duty upon them—are extremely apt to assume
this cross when they reach a certain stage of development.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Margaret Fuller first came forward into literature,
she supposed that literature was all she wanted.
It was not till she came to write upon woman’s position
that she discovered what woman needed. Clara Barton,
driving her ambulance or her supply-wagon at the
battle’s edge, did not foresee, perhaps, that she should
make that touching appeal, when the battle was over,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>imploring her own enfranchisement from the soldiers
she had befriended. Lydia Maria Child, Julia Ward
Howe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa Alcott, came to
the claim for the ballot earlier than a million others,
because they were the intellectual leaders of American
womanhood. They saw farthest, because they were in
the highest place. They were the recognized representatives
of their sex before they gave in their adhesion
to the new demand. Their judgment is as the
judgment of the council of officers; while Flora McFlimsey’s
opinion is as the opinion of John Smith,
unassigned recruit. But, if the generals make arrangements
for a battle, the chance is that John Smith will
have to take a hand in it, or else run away.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a rare thing for the petition for suffrage from
any town to comprise the majority of women in that
town. It makes no difference: if there are few women
in the town who want to vote, there is as much
propriety in their voting as if there were ten millions,
so long as the majority are equally protected in their
right to stay at home. But, when the names of petitioners
come to be weighed as well as counted, the
character, the purity, the intelligence, the social and
domestic value, of the petitioners, is seldom denied.
The women who wish to vote are not the idle, the ignorant,
the narrow-minded, or the vicious; they are
not “the dangerous classes:” they represent the best
class in the community, when tried by the highest
standard. They are the natural leaders. What they
now see to be right, will also be perceived even by the
foolish and the ignorant by and by.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a poultry-yard in spring, when the first brood of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>ducklings go toddling to the water-side, no doubt all
the younger or feebler broods, just hatched out of
similar eggs, think these innovators dreadfully mistaken.
“You are out of place,” they feebly pipe.
“See how happy we are in our safe nests. Perhaps,
by and by, when properly introduced into society, we
may run about a little on land, but to swim!—never!”
Meanwhile their elder kindred are splashing and diving
in ecstasy; and, so surely as they are born ducklings,
all the rest will swim in their turn. The instinct
of the first duck solves the problem for all the rest. It
is a mere question of time. Sooner or later, all the
broods in the most conservative yard will follow their
leaders.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>HOW TO MAKE WOMEN UNDERSTAND POLITICS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>An English member of Parliament said in a speech,
some years ago, that the stupidest man had a clearer
understanding of political questions than the brightest
woman. He did not find it convenient to say what must
be the condition of a nation which for many years has
had a woman for its sovereign; but he certainly said
bluntly what many men feel. It is not indeed very
hard to find the source of this feeling. It is not
merely that women are inexperienced in questions of
finance or administrative practice, for many men are
equally ignorant of these. But it is undoubtedly true
of a large class of more fundamental questions,—as,
for instance, of some now pending at Washington,—which
even many clear-headed women find it hard to
understand, while men of far less general training comprehend
them entirely. Questions of the distribution
of power, for instance, between the executive, judicial,
and legislative branches of government,—or between
the United States government and those of the separate
States,—belong to the class I mean. Many
women of great intelligence show a hazy indistinctness
of views when the question arises whether it is
the business of the General Government to preserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>order at the voting-places at a congressional election,
for instance, as the Republicans hold; or whether it
should be left absolutely in the hands of the State officials,
as the Democrats maintain. Most women would
probably say that so long as order was preserved, it
made very little difference who did it. Yet, if one
goes into a shoe-shop or a blacksmith’s shop, one may
hear just these questions discussed in all their bearings
by uneducated men, and it will be seen that they involve
a principle. Why is this difference? Does it
show some constitutional inferiority in women, as to
this particular faculty?</p>

<p class='c014'>The question is best solved by considering a case
somewhat parallel. The South Carolina negroes were
considered very stupid, even by many who knew them;
and they certainly were densely ignorant on many subjects.
Put face to face with a difficult point of finance
legislation, I think they would have been found to
know even less about it than I do. Yet the abolition
of slavery was held in those days by many great statesmen
to be a subject so difficult that they shrank from
discussing it; and nevertheless I used to find that
these ignorant men understood it quite clearly in all
its bearings. Offer a bit of sophistry to them, try to
blind them with false logic on this subject, and they
would detect it as promptly, and answer it as keenly, as
Garrison or Phillips would have done; and, indeed,
they would give very much the same answers. What
was the reason? Not that they were half wise and half
stupid; but that they were dull where their own interests
had not trained them, and they were sharp and
keen where their own interests were concerned.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>I have no doubt that it will be so with women when
they vote. About some things they will be slow to
learn; but, about all that immediately concerns themselves,
they will know more at the very beginning than
many wise men have learned since the world began.
How long it took for English-speaking men to correct,
even partially, the iniquities of the old common law!—but
a parliament of women would have set aside at a
single sitting the alleged right of the husband to correct
his wife with a stick no bigger than his thumb.
It took the men of a certain State of this Union a good
many years to see that it was an outrage to confiscate
to the State one-half the property of a man who died
childless, leaving his widow only the other half; but a
legislature of women would have annihilated that enormity
by a single day’s work. I have never seen reason
to believe that women on general questions would
act more wisely or more conscientiously, as a rule,
than men: but self-preservation is a wonderful quickener
of the brain; and, in all questions bearing on
their own rights and opportunities as women, it is
they who will prove shrewd and keen, and men who
will prove obtuse, as indeed they have usually been.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another point that adds force to this is the fact that
wherever women, by their special position, have more
at stake than usual in public affairs, even as now organized,
they are apt to be equal to the occasion.
When the men of South Carolina were ready to go to
war for the “States-Rights” doctrines of Calhoun, the
women of that State had also those doctrines at their
fingers’-ends. At Washington, where politics make the
breath of life, you will often find the wives of members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>of Congress following the debates, and noting every
point gained or lost, because these are matters in which
they and their families are personally concerned; and,
as for that army of women employed in the “departments”
of the government, they are politicians every
one, because their bread depends upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The inference is, that, if women as a class are now
unfitted for politics, it is because they have not that
pressure of personal interest and responsibility by
which men are unconsciously trained. Give this, and
self-interest will do the rest; aided by that power of
conscience and affection which is certainly not less in
them than in men, even if we claim no more. A
young lady of my acquaintance opposed woman suffrage
in conversation on various grounds, one of
which was that it would, if enacted, compel her to
read the newspapers, which she greatly disliked. I
pleaded that this was not a fatal objection; since many
men voted “early and often” without reading them,
and in fact without knowing how to read at all. She
said, in reply, that this might do for men, but that
women were far more conscientious, and, if they were
once compelled to vote, they would wish to know what
they were voting for. This seemed to me to contain
the whole philosophy of the matter; and I respected
the keenness of her suggestion, though it led me to an
opposite conclusion.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>LXXXIX.<br /> <span class='large'>“INFERIOR TO MAN, AND NEAR TO ANGELS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>If it were anywhere the custom to disfranchise persons
of superior virtue because of their virtue, and to
present others with the ballot, simply because they
had been in the State Prison,—then the exclusion of
women from political rights would be a high compliment,
no doubt. But I can find no record in history
of any such legislation, unless so far as it is contained
in the doubtful tradition of the Tuscan city of Pistoia,
where men are said to have been ennobled as a punishment
for crime. Among us crime may often be a
covert means of political prominence, but it is not the
ostensible ground; nor are people habitually struck
from the voting-lists for performing some rare and
eminent service, such as saving human life, or reading
every word of a Presidential message. If a man has
been President of the United States, we do not disfranchise
him thenceforward; if he has been governor,
we do not declare him thenceforth ineligible to the
office of United States senator. On the contrary, the
supposed reward of high merit is to give higher civic
privileges. Sometimes these are even forced on unwilling
recipients, as when Plymouth Colony in 1633
imposed a fine of twenty pounds on any one who should
refuse the office of governor.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>It is utterly contrary to all tradition and precedent,
therefore, to suppose that women have been hitherto
disfranchised because of any supposed superiority.
Indeed, the theory is self-annihilating, and involves all
supporters in hopeless inconsistency. Thus the Southern
slaveholders were wont to argue that a negro was
only blest when a slave, and there was no such inhumanity
as to free him. Then, if a slave happened to
save his master’s life, he was rewarded by emancipation
immediately, amid general applause. The act
refuted the theory. And so, every time we have disfranchised
a rebel, or presented some eminent foreigner
with the freedom of a city, we have recognized that
enfranchisement, after all, means honor, and disfranchisement
implies disgrace.</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not see how any woman can help a thrill of
indignation, when she first opens her eyes to the fact
that it is really contempt, not reverence, that has so
long kept her sex from an equal share of legal, political,
and educational rights. In spite of the duty paid
to individual women as mothers, in spite of the reverence
paid by the Greeks and the Germanic races
to certain women as priestesses and sibyls, the fact
remains that this sex has been generally recognized,
in past ages of the human race, as stamped by hopeless
inferiority, not by angelic superiority. This is carried
so far, that a certain taint of actual inferiority is held
to attach to women, in barbarous nations. Among
certain Indian tribes, the service of the gods is defiled
if a woman but touches the implements of sacrifice;
and a Turk apologizes to a Christian physician for the
mention of the women of his family, in the phrases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>used to soften the mention of any degrading creature.
Mr. Leland tells us, that, among the English gypsies,
any object that a woman treads upon, or sweeps with
the skirts of her dress, is destroyed or made away with
in some way, as unfit for use. In reading the history
of manners, it is easy to trace the steps from this
degradation up to the point now attained, such as it is.
Yet even the habit of physiological contempt is not
gone, as readers of late controversies on “Sex in Education”
know full well; and I do not see how any
one can read history without seeing, all around us, in
society, education, and politics, the tradition of inferiority.
Many laws and usages which in themselves
might not strike all women as intrinsically worth
striving for—as the exclusion of women from colleges
or from the ballot-box—assume great importance to
a woman’s self-respect, when she sees in these the plain
survival of the same contempt that once took much
grosser forms.</p>

<p class='c014'>And it must be remembered that in civilized communities
the cynics, who still frankly express this utter
contempt, are better friends to women than the flatterers,
who conceal it in the drawing-room, and only utter
it freely in the lecture-room, the club, and the North
American Review. Contempt at least arouses pride
and energy. To be sure, in the face of history, the
contemptuous tone in regard to women seems to me
untrue, unfair, and dastardly; but, like any other extreme
injustice, it leads to re-action. It helps to awaken
women from that shallow dream of self-complacency
into which flattery lulls them. There is something
tonic in the manly arrogance of Fitzjames Stephen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>who derides the thought that the marriage-contract can
be treated as in any sense a contract between equals;
but there is something that debilitates in the dulcet
counsel given by an anonymous gentleman, in an old
volume of the Ladies’ Magazine that lies before me,
“She ought to present herself as a being made to
please, to love, and to seek support; <em>a being inferior
to man, and near to angels.</em>”</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XC.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FACT OF SEX.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is constantly said that the advocates of woman
suffrage ignore the fact of sex. On the contrary, they
seem to me to be the only people who do not ignore it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Were there no such thing as sexual difference, the
wrong done to woman by disfranchisement would be
far less. It is precisely because her traits, habits,
needs, and probable demands are distinct from those
of man, that she is not, never was, never can, and
never will be, justly represented by him. It is not
merely that a vast number of human individuals are
disfranchised; it is not even because in many of our
States the disfranchisement extends to a majority, that
the evil is so great; it is not merely that we disfranchise
so many units and tens: but we exclude a special
element, a peculiar power, a distinct interest,—in a
word, a sex.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whether this sex is more or less wise, more or less
important, than the other sex, does not affect the argument:
it is a sex, and, being such, is more absolutely
distinct from the other than is any mere race from any
other race. The more you emphasize the fact of sex,
the more you strengthen our argument. If the white
man cannot justly represent the negro,—although the
two races are now so amalgamated that not even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>microscope can always decide to which race one belongs,—how
impossible that one sex should stand in
legislation for the other sex!</p>

<p class='c014'>This is so clear, that, so soon as it is stated, there is
a shifting of the ground. “But consider the danger
of introducing the sexual influence into legislation!”&nbsp;...
Then we are sure to be confronted with the case
of Miss Vinnie Ream, the sculptor. See how that
beguiling damsel cajoled all Congress into buying poor
statues! they say. If one woman could do so much,
how would it be with one hundred? Precisely the Irishman’s
argument against the use of pillows: he had put
one feather on a rock, and found it a very uncomfortable
support. Grant, for the sake of argument, that
Miss Ream gave us poor art; but what gave her so
much power? Plainly, that she was but a single feather.
Congress being composed exclusively of men, the
mere fact of her sex gave her an exceptional and dangerous
influence. Fill a dozen of the seats in Congress
with women, and that danger at least will be cancelled.
The taste in art may be no better; but an artist will
no more be selected for being a pretty girl than now
for being a pretty boy. So in all such cases. Here,
as everywhere, it is the advocate of woman suffrage
who wishes to recognize the fact of sex, and guard
against its perils.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is precisely so in education. Believing boys and
girls to be unlike, and yet seeing them to be placed by
the Creator on the same planet and in the same family,
we hold it safer to follow his method. As they are born
to interest each other, to stimulate each other, to excite
each other, it seems better to let this impulse work itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>off in a natural way,—to let in upon it the fresh air
and the daylight, instead of attempting to suppress and
destroy it. In a mixed school, as in a family, the fact
of sex presents itself as an unconscious, healthy, mutual
stimulus. It is in the separate schools that the
healthy relation vanishes, and the thought of sex becomes
a morbid and diseased thing. This observation
first occurred to me when a pupil and a teacher in boys’
boarding-schools years ago: there was such marked
superiority as to sexual refinement in the day-scholars,
who saw their sisters and the friends of their sisters
every day. All later experience of our public-school
system has confirmed this opinion. It is because I
believe the distinction of sex to be momentous, that
I dread to see the sexes educated apart.</p>

<p class='c014'>The truth of the whole matter is, that Nature will
have her rights—innocently if she can, guiltily if she
must; and it is a little amusing that the writer of an
ingenious paper on the other side, called “Sex in Politics,”
in an able New York journal, puts our case
better than I can put it, before he gets through, only
that he is then speaking of wealth, not women: “Anybody
who considers seriously what is meant by the
conflict between labor and capital, of which we are
only just witnessing the beginning, and what is to be
done <em>to give money legitimately that influence on legislation
which it now exercises illegitimately</em>, must acknowledge
at once that the next generation will have a thorny
path to travel.” The Italics are my own. Precisely
what this writer wishes to secure for money, we claim
for the disfranchised half of the human race,—open
instead of secret influence; the English tradition instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>of the French; women as rulers, not as kings’
mistresses; women as legislators, not merely as lobbyists;
women employing in legitimate form that power
which they will otherwise illegitimately wield. This is
all our demand.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XCI.<br /> <span class='large'>HOW WILL IT RESULT?</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“It would be a great convenience, my hearers,”
said old Parson Withington of Newbury, “if the moral
of a fable could only be written at the beginning of it,
instead of the end. But it never is.” Commonly the
only thing to be done is to get hold of a few general
principles, hold to those, and trust that all will turn out
well. No matter how thoroughly a reform may have
been discussed,—negro-emancipation or free-trade, for
instance,—it is a step in the dark at last, and the detailed
results never turn out to be precisely according
to the programme.</p>

<p class='c014'>An “esteemed correspondent,” who has written
some of the best things yet said in America in behalf
of the enfranchisement of woman, writes privately to
express some solicitude, since, as she thinks, we are
not ready for it yet. “I am convinced,” she writes,
“of the abstract right of women to vote; but all I see
of the conduct of the existing women, into whose
hands this change would throw the power, inclines me
to hope that this power will not be conceded till education
shall have prepared a class of women fit to take
the responsibilities.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Gradual emancipation, in short!—for fear of trusting
truth and justice to take care of themselves. Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>knew, when the negroes were set free, whether they
would at first use their freedom well, or ill? Would
they work? would they avoid crimes? would they justify
their freedom? The theory of education and preparation
seemed very plausible. Against that, there was
only the plain theory which Elizabeth Heyrick first
announced to England,—“Immediate, unconditional
emancipation.” “The best preparation for freedom
is freedom.” What was true of the negroes then is
true of women now.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The lovelier traits of womanhood,” writes earnestly
our correspondent, “simplicity, faith, guilelessness,
unfit them to conduct public affairs, where one
must deal with quacks and charlatans.... We are
not all at once ‘as gods, knowing good and evil;’ and
the very innocency of our lives, and the habits of pure
homes, unfit us to manage a certain class who will flock
to this standard.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But the basis of all republican government is in the
assumption that good is ultimately stronger than evil.
If we once abandon this, our theory has gone to pieces,
at any rate. If we hold to it, good women are no
more helpless and useless than good men. The argument
that would here disfranchise women has been used
before now to disfranchise clergymen. I believe that
in some States they are still disfranchised; and, if they
are not, it is partly because good is found to be as
strong as evil, after all, and partly because clergymen
are not found to be so angelically good as to be useless.
I am very confident that both these truths will
be found to apply to women also.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whatever else happens, we may be pretty sure that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>one thing will. The first step towards the enfranchisement
of women will blow to the winds the tradition of
the angelic superiority of women. Just as surely as
women vote, we shall have occasionally women politicians,
women corruptionists, and women demagogues.
Conceding, for the sake of courtesy, that none such
now exist, they will be born as instantaneously, after
enfranchisement, as the frogs begin to pipe in the
spring. Those who doubt it ignore human nature;
and, if they are not prepared for this fact, they had
better consider it in season, and take sides accordingly.
In these pages, at least, they have been warned.</p>

<p class='c014'>What then? Suppose women are not “as gods,
knowing good and evil:” they are not to be emancipated
as gods, but as fallible human beings. They
are to come out of an ignorant innocence, that may
be only weakness, into a wise innocence that will be
strength. It is too late to remand American women
into a Turkish or Jewish tutelage: they have emerged
too far not to come farther. In a certain sense, no
doubt, the butterfly is safest in the chrysalis. When
the soft thing begins to emerge, the world certainly
seems a dangerous place; and it is hard to say what
will be the result of the emancipation. But when she
is once half out, there is no safety for the pretty creature
but to come the rest of the way, and use her wings.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XCII.<br /> <span class='large'>“I HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS I WANT.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When Dr. Johnson had published his English Dictionary,
and was asked by a lady how he chanced to
make a certain mistake that she pointed out, he answered,
“Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance.” I
always feel disposed to make the same comment on the
assertion of any woman that she has all the rights she
wants. For every woman is, or may be, or might have
been, a mother. And when she comes to know that
even now, in many parts of the Union, a married mother
has no legal right to her child, I should think her tongue
would cleave to her mouth before she would utter those
foolish words again.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the things I ever heard or read against slavery
did not fix in my soul such a hostility to it as a single
scene in a Missouri slave-market some twenty-five years
ago. As I sat there, a purchaser came in to buy a
little girl to wait on his wife. Three little sisters were
brought in, from eight to twelve years old: they were
mulattoes, with sweet, gentle manners; they had evidently
been taken good care of, and their pink-calico
frocks were clean and whole. The gentleman chose one
of them, and then asked her, good-naturedly enough,
if she did not wish to go with him. She burst into
tears, and said, “I would rather stay with my mother.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>But her tears were as powerless, of course, as so many
salt drops from the ocean.</p>

<p class='c014'>That was all. But all the horrors of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” the stories told me by fugitive slaves, the
scarred backs I afterwards saw by dozens among colored
recruits, did not impress me as did that hour in the jail.
The whole probable career of that poor, wronged,
motherless, shrinking child passed before me in fancy.
It seemed to me that a man must be utterly lost to all
manly instincts who would not give his life to overthrow
such a system. It seemed to me that the woman who
could tolerate, much less defend it, could not herself be
true, could not be pure, or must be fearfully and grossly
ignorant.</p>

<p class='c014'>You acquiesce, fair lady. You say it was horrible
indeed, but, thank God! it is past. Past? Is it so?
Past, if you please, as to the law of slavery, but, as to
the legal position of woman, still a fearful reality. It
is not twelve years since a scene took place in a Boston
court-room, before Chief-Justice Chapman, which was
worse, in this respect, than that scene in St. Louis, inasmuch
as the mother was present when the child was
taken away, and the wrong was sanctioned by the highest
judicial officer of the State. Two little girls, who
had been taken from their mother by their guardian,
their father being dead, had taken refuge with her
against his wishes; and he brought them into court
under a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, and the court awarded
them to him as against their mother. “The little ones
were very much affected,” says the Boston Herald, “by
the result of the decision which separated them from
their mother; and force was required to remove them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>from the court-room. The distress of the mother was
also very evident.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There must have been some special reason, you say,
for such a seeming outrage: she was a bad woman.
No: she was “a lady of the highest respectability.”
No charge was made against her: but, being left a
widow, she had married again; and for that, and that
only, so far as appears, the court took from her the
guardianship of her own children,—bone of her bone,
and flesh of her flesh, the children for whom she had
borne the deepest physical agony of womanhood,—and
awarded them to somebody else.</p>

<p class='c014'>You say, “But her second husband might have misused
the children.” Might? So the guardian might,
and that where they had no mother to protect them.
Had the father been left a widower, he might have
made a half-dozen successive marriages, have brought
stepmother after stepmother to control these children,
and no court could have interfered. The father is recognized
before the law as the natural guardian of the
children. The mother, even though she be left a widow,
is not. The consequence is a series of outrages of which
only a few scattered instances come before the public;
just as in slavery, out of a hundred little girls sold away
from their parents, only one case might ever be mentioned
in any newspaper.</p>

<p class='c014'>This case led to an alteration of the law in Massachusetts,
but the same thing might yet happen in some
States of the Union. The possibility of a single such
occurrence shows that there is still a fundamental wrong
in the legal position of woman. And the fact that
most women do not know it, only deepens the wrong—as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Dr. Channing said of the contentment of the
Southern slaves. The mass of men, even of lawyers,
pass by such things, as they formerly passed by the
facts of slavery.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no lasting remedy for these wrongs, except
to give woman the political power to protect herself.
There never yet existed a race, nor a class, nor a sex,
which was noble enough to be trusted with political
power over another sex, or class, or race. It is for
self-defence that woman needs the ballot. And, in view
of a single such occurrence as I have given, I charge
that woman who professes to have “all the rights she
wants,” either with a want of all feeling of motherhood,
or with “ignorance, madam, pure ignorance.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XCIII.<br /> <span class='large'>“SENSE ENOUGH TO VOTE.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is one special point on which men seem to me
rather insincere toward women. When they speak to
women, the objection made to their voting is usually
that they are too angelic. But when men talk to each
other, the general assumption is, that women should not
vote because they have not brains enough—or, as old
Theophilus Parsons wrote a century ago, have not “a
sufficient acquired discretion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is an important distinction. Because, if women are
too angelic to vote, they can only be fitted for it by
becoming more wicked, which is not desirable. On the
other hand, if there is no objection but the want of
brains, then our public schools are equalizing that matter
fast enough. Still, there are plenty of people who
have never got beyond this objection. Listen to the
first discussion that you encounter among men on this
subject, wherever they may congregate. Does it turn
upon the question of saintliness, or of brains? Let us
see.</p>

<p class='c014'>I travelled the other day upon the Boston and Providence
Railroad with a party of mechanics, mostly English
and Scotch. They were discussing this very question,
and, with the true English habit, thought it was
all a matter of property. Without it a woman certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>should not vote, they said; but they all favored, to my
surprise, the enfranchisement of women of property.
“As a general rule,” said the chief speaker, “a woman
that’s got property has got sense enough to vote.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There it was! These foreigners, who had found
their own manhood by coming to a land which not only
the Pilgrim Fathers but the Pilgrim Mothers had settled,
and subdued, and freed for them, were still ready to
disfranchise most of the daughters of those mothers,
on the ground that they had not “sense enough to
vote.” I thanked them for their blunt truthfulness,
so much better than the flattery of most of the native-born.</p>

<p class='c014'>My other instance shall be a conversation overheard
in a railway-station near Boston, between two intelligent
citizens, who had lately listened to Anna Dickinson.
“The best of it was,” said one, “to see our
minister introduce her.”—“Wonder what the Orthodox
churches would have said to that ten years ago?” said
the other. “Never mind,” was the answer. “Things
have changed. What I think is, it’s all in the bringing
up. If women were brought up just as men are, they’d
have just as much brains.” (Brains again!) “That’s
what Beecher says. Boys are brought up to do business,
and take care of themselves: that’s where it is.
Girls are brought up to dress and get married. Start
’em alike! That’s what Beecher says. Start ’em alike,
and see if girls haven’t got just as much brains.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Still harping on my daughter,” and on the condition
of her brains! It is on this that the whole question
turns, in the opinion of many men. Ask ten men
their objections to woman suffrage. One will plead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>that women are angels. Another fears discord in families.
Another points out that women cannot fight,—he
himself being very likely a non-combatant. Another
quotes St. Paul for this purpose,—not being, perhaps,
in the habit of consulting that authority on any other
point. But with the others, very likely, every thing will
turn on the question of brains. They believe, or think
they believe, that women have not sense enough to vote.
They may not say so to women, but they habitually say
it to men. If you wish to meet the common point of
view of masculine voters, you must find it here.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is fortunate that it is so. Of all points, this is the
easiest to settle; for every intelligent woman, even if she
be opposed to woman suffrage, helps to settle it. Every
good lecture by a woman, every good book written by
one, every successful business enterprise carried on,
helps to decide the question. Every class of girls that
graduates from every good school helps to pile up the
argument on this point. And the vast army of women,
constituting nine out of ten of the teachers in our
American schools, may appeal as logically to their pupils,
and settle the argument based on brains. “If we
had sense enough to educate you,” they may say to
each graduating class of boys, “we have sense enough
to vote beside you.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>XCIV.<br /> <span class='large'>AN INFELICITOUS EPITHET.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c031'>“The ladies actively working to secure the co-operation of
their sex in caucuses and citizens’ conventions are not actuated
by love of notoriety, and are not, therefore, to be classed with
the absolute woman suffragists.”—<cite>Boston Daily Transcript</cite>,
Sept. 1, 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the eloquent colored abolitionist, Charles
Remond, once said upon the platform that George
Washington, having been a slaveholder, was a villain,
Wendell Phillips remonstrated by saying, “Charles,
the epithet is not felicitous.” Reformers are apt to
be pelted with epithets quite as ill-chosen. How often
has the charge figured in history, that they were “actuated
by love of notoriety”! The early Christians,
it was generally believed, took a positive pleasure in
being thrown to the lions, under the influence of this
motive; and at a later period there was a firm conviction
that the Huguenots consented readily to being
broken on the wheel, or sawed in pieces between two
boards, feeling amply rewarded by the pleasure of being
talked about. During the whole anti-slavery movement,
while the abolitionists were mobbed, fined, and
imprisoned,—while they were tabooed by good society,
depleted of their money, kept out of employment,
checked in their advancement, by the mere fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>of their abolitionism,—there never was a moment when
their sole motive was not considered by many persons
to be the love of notoriety. Why should the advocates
of woman suffrage expect any different treatment
now?</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not necessary, in order to dispose of this charge,
to claim that all reformers are heroes or saints. Even
in the infancy of any reform, it takes along with it
some poor material; and unpleasant traits are often
developed by the incidents of the contest. Doubtless
many reformers attain to a certain enjoyment of a fight,
at last: it is one of the dangerous tendencies which
those committed to this vocation must resist. But, so
far as my observation goes, those who engage in reform
for the sake of notoriety generally hurt the reform so
much that they render it their chief service when they
leave it; and this happy desertion usually comes pretty
early in their career. The besetting sin of reformers
is not, so far as I can judge, the love of notoriety, but
the love of power and of flattery within their own small
circle,—a temptation quite different from the other,
both in its origin and its results.</p>

<p class='c014'>Notoriety comes so soon to a reformer, that its
charms, whatever they may be, soon pall upon the
palate, just as they do in case of a popular poet or
orator, who is so used to seeing his name in print that
he hardly notices it. I suppose there is no young person
so modest that he does not, on first seeing his name
in a newspaper, cut out the passage with a certain tender
solicitude, and perhaps purchase a few extra copies of
the fortunate journal. But when the same person has
been battered by a score or two of years in successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>unpopular reforms, I suppose that he not only would
leave the paper uncut or unpurchased, but would hardly
take the pains even to correct a misstatement, were it
asserted that he had inherited a fortune or murdered
his grandmother. The moral is, that the love of notoriety
is soon amply filled, in a reformer’s experience,
and that he will not, as a rule, sacrifice home and comfort,
money and friends, without some stronger inducement.
This is certainly true of most of the men who
have interested themselves in this particular movement,
the “weak-minded men,” as the reporters, with witty
antithesis, still describe them; and it must be much the
same with the “strong-minded women” who share
their base career.</p>

<p class='c014'>And it is to be remembered, above all, that, considered
as an engine for obtaining notoriety, the woman
suffrage agitation is a great waste of energy. The
same net result could have been won with far less
expenditure in other ways. There is not a woman connected
with it who could not have achieved far more
real publicity as a manager of charity fairs or as a
sensation letter-writer. She could have done this, too,
with far less trouble, without the loss of a single
“genteel” friend, without forfeiting a single social
attention, without having a single ill-natured thing said
about her—except perhaps that she bored people, a
charge to which the highest and lowest forms of prominence
are equally open. Nay, she might have done
even more than this, if notoriety was her sole aim: for
she might have become a “variety” minstrel or a female
pedestrian; she might have written a scandalous
novel; she might have got somebody to aim at her that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>harmless pistol, which has helped the fame of so many
a wandering actress, while its bullet somehow never
hits any thing but the wall. All this she might have
done, and obtained a notoriety beyond doubt. Instead
of this, she has preferred to prowl about, picking up a
precarious publicity by giving lectures to willing lyceums,
writing books for eager publishers, organizing
schools, setting up hospitals, and achieving for her sex
something like equal rights before the law. Either she
has shown herself, as a seeker after notoriety, to be a
most foolish or ill-judging person,—or else, as was

  <h3 class='c004'>XCV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ROB ROY THEORY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Saturday Review, in an article which denounces
all equality in marriage-laws and all plans of
woman-suffrage, admits frankly the practical obstacles
in the way of the process of voting. “Possibly the
presence of women as voters would tend still further to
promote order than has been done by the ballot.” It
plants itself wholly on one objection, which goes far
deeper, thus:—</p>

<p class='c021'>“If men choose to say that women are not their equals,
women have nothing to do but to give in. Physical force, the
ultimate basis of all society and all government, must be on the
side of the men; and those who have the key of the position
will not consent permanently to abandon it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a great pleasure when an opponent of justice is
willing to fall back thus frankly upon the Rob Roy
theory:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in21'>“The good old rule</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sufficeth him, the simple plan</div>
      <div class='line'>That they should take who have the power,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And they should keep who can.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is easy, I think, to show that the theory is utterly
false, and that the basis of civilized society is not
physical force, but, on the contrary, brains.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>In the city where the Saturday Review is published,
there are three regiments of “Guards” which
are the boast of the English army, and are believed by
their officers to be the finest troops in the world. They
have deteriorated in size since the Crimean war; but I
believe that the men of one regiment still average six
feet two inches in height; and I am sure that nobody
ever saw them in line, without noticing the contrast
between these magnificent men and the comparatively
puny officers who command them. These officers are
from the highest social rank in England, the governing
classes; and, if it were the whole object of this military
organization to give a visible proof of the utter
absurdity of the Saturday Review’s theory, it could
not be better done. There is no country in Europe,
I suppose, where the hereditary aristocracy is physically
equal to that of England, or where the intellectual class
has so good a physique. But set either the House of
Lords or the Saturday Review contributors upon a
hand-to-hand fight against an equal number of “navvies”
or “costermongers,” and the patricians would
have about as much chance as a crew of Vassar girls
in a boat-race with Yale or Harvard. Take the men
of England alone, and it is hardly too much to say
that physical force, instead of being the basis of political
power in any class, is apt to be found in inverse
ratio to it. In case of revolution, the strength of the
governing class in any country is not in its physical,
but in its mental power. Rank and money, and the
power to influence and organize and command, are
merely different modifications of mental training,
brought to bear by somebody.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>In our country, without class distinctions, the same
truth can be easily shown. Physical power lies mainly
in the hands of the masses: wherever a class or profession
possesses more than its numerical share of
power, it has usually less than its proportion of physical
vigor. This is easily shown from the vast body of
evidence collected during our civil war. In the volume
containing the medical statistics of the Provost Marshal
General’s Bureau, we have the tabulated reports
of about 600,000 persons subject to draft, and of
about 500,000 recruits, substitutes, and drafted men;
showing the precise physical condition of more than a
million men.</p>

<p class='c014'>It appears, that, out of the whole number examined,
rather more than 257 in each 1,000 were found unfit for
military service. It is curious to see how generally
the physical power among these men is in inverse ratio
to the social and political prominence of the class they
represent. Out of 1,000 unskilled laborers, for instance,
only 348 are physically disqualified; among
tanners, only 216; among iron-workers, 189. On the
other hand, among lawyers, 544 out of 1,000 are disqualified;
among journalists, 740; among clergymen,
954. Grave divines are horrified at the thought of
admitting women to vote, when they cannot fight;
though not one of twenty of their own number is fit for
military duty, if he volunteered. Of the editors who
denounce woman suffrage, only about one in four could
himself carry a musket; while, of the lawyers who fill
Congress, the majority could not be defenders of their
country, but could only be defended. If we were to
distribute political power with reference to the “physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>basis” which the Saturday Review talks about,
it would be a wholly new distribution, and would put
things more hopelessly upside down than did the worst
phase of the French Commune. If, then, a political
theory so utterly breaks down when applied to men,
why should we insist on resuscitating it in order to
apply it to women? The truth is, that, as civilization
advances, the world is governed more and more unequivocally
by brains; and whether those brains are
deposited in a strong body or a weak one becomes a
matter of less and less importance. But it is only in
the very first stage of barbarism that mere physical
strength makes mastery; and the long head has controlled
the long arm since the beginning of recorded
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>And it must be remembered that even these statistics
very imperfectly represent the case. They do not apply
to the whole male sex, but actually to the picked portion
only, to the men presumed to be of military age,
excluding the very old and the very young. Were
these included, the proportion unfit for military duty
would of course be far greater. Moreover, it takes no
account of courage or cowardice, patriotism or zeal.
How much all these considerations tell upon the actual
proportion, may be seen from the fact, that in the town
where I am writing, for instance, out of some twelve
thousand inhabitants and about three thousand voters,
there are only some three hundred who actually served
in the civil war,—a number too small to exert a perceptible
influence on any local election. When we see
the community yielding up its voting power into the
hands of those who have actually done military service,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>it will be time enough to exclude women for not
doing such service. If the alleged physical basis operates
as an exclusion of all non-combatants, it should
surely give a monopoly to the actual combatants.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XCVI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VOTES OF NON-COMBATANTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The tendency of modern society is not to concentrate
power in the hands of the few, but to give a greater and
greater share to the many. Read Froissart’s Chronicles,
and Scott’s novels of chivalry, and you will see
how thoroughly the difference between patrician and
plebeian was then a difference of physical strength.
The knight, being better nourished and better trained,
was apt to be the bodily superior of the peasant, to
begin with; and this strength was re-enforced by armor,
weapons, horse, castle, and all the resources of feudal
warfare. With this greater strength went naturally the
assumption of greater political power. To the heroes
of “Ivanhoe,” or “The Fair Maid of Perth,” it would
have seemed as absurd that yeomen and lackeys should
have any share in the government, as it would seem to
the members in an American legislature that women
should have any such share. In a contest of mailed
knights, any number of unarmed men were but so many
women. As Sir Philip Sidney said, “The wolf asketh
not how many the sheep may be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But time and advancing civilization have tended
steadily in one direction. “He giveth power to the
weak, and to them who have no might He increaseth
strength.” Every step in the extension of political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>rights has consisted in opening them to a class hitherto
humbler. From kings to nobles, from nobles to burghers,
from burghers to yeomen; in short, from strong to
weak, from high to low, from rich to poor. All this is
but the unconscious following-out of one sure principle,—that
legislation is mainly for the protection of
the weak against the strong, and that for this purpose
the weak must be directly represented. The strong
are already protected by their strength: it is the weak
who need all the vantage-ground that votes and legislatures
can give them. The feudal chiefs were stronger
without laws than with them. “Take care of yourselves
in Sutherland,” was the anxious message of the
old Highlander: “the law has come as far as Tain.”
It was the peaceful citizen who needed the guaranty of
law against brute force.</p>

<p class='c014'>But can laws be executed without brute force? Not
without a certain amount of it, but that amount under
civilization grows less and less. Just in proportion as
the masses are enfranchised, statutes execute themselves
without crossing bayonets. “In a republic,”
said De Tocqueville, “if laws are not always respectable,
they are always respected.” If every step in
freedom has brought about a more peaceable state of
society, why should that process stop at this precise
point? Besides, there is no possibility in nature of a
political division in which all the men shall be on one
side and all the women on the other. The mutual influence
of the sexes forbids it. The very persons who
hint at such a fear refute themselves at other times, by
arguing that “women will always be sufficiently represented
by men,” or that “every woman will vote as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>her husband thinks, and it will merely double the numbers.”
As a matter of fact, the law will prevail in all
English-speaking nations: a few men fighting for it will
be stronger than many fighting against it; and, if those
few have both the law and the women on their side,
there will be no trouble.</p>

<p class='c014'>The truth is, that, in this age, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cedant arma togæ</span></i>: it is
the civilian who rules on the throne or behind it, and
who makes the fighting-men his mere agents. Yonder
policeman at the corner looks big and formidable: he
protects the women, and overawes the boys. But away
in some corner of the City Hall, there is some quiet
man, out of uniform, perhaps a consumptive or a dyspeptic
or a cripple, who can overawe the burliest
policeman by his authority as city marshal or as
mayor. So an army is but a larger police; and its
official head is that plain man at the White House, who
makes or unmakes, not merely brevet-brigadiers, but
major-generals in command,—who can by the stroke of
the pen convert the most powerful man of the army
into the most powerless. Take away the occupant of
the position, and put in a woman, and will she become
impotent because her name is Elizabeth or Maria
Theresa? It is brains that more and more govern the
world; and whether those brains be on the throne, or
at the ballot-box, they will soon make the owner’s
sex a subordinate affair. If woman is also strong in
the affections, so much the better. “Win the hearts
of your subjects,” said Lord Burleigh to Queen Elizabeth,
“and you will have their hands and purses.”</p>

<p class='c014'>War is the last appeal, and happily in these days
the rarest appeal, of statesmanship. In the multifarious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>other duties that make up statesmanship, we cannot
spare the brains, the self-devotion, and the enthusiasm,
of woman. One of the most important treaties of
modern history, the peace of Cambray, in 1529, was
negotiated, after previous attempts had failed, by two
women,—Margaret, aunt of Charles V., and Louisa,
mother of Francis I. Voltaire said that Christina of
Sweden was the only sovereign of her time who maintained
the dignity of the throne against Mazarin and
Richelieu. Frederick the Great said that the Seven
Years’ War was waged against three women,—Elizabeth
of Russia, Maria Theresa, and Mme. Pompadour.
There is nothing impotent in the statesmanship of
women when they are admitted to exercise it: they are
only powerless for good when they are obliged to obtain
by wheedling and flattery a sway that should be recognized,
responsible, and limited.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XCVII.<br /> <span class='large'>“MANNERS REPEAL LAWS.”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is in Boswell’s Life of Johnson a correspondence
which is well worth reading by both advocates and
opponents of woman suffrage. Boswell, who was of
an old Scotch family, had a difference of opinion with
his father about an entailed estate which had descended
to them. Boswell wished the title so adjusted as to
cut off all possibility of female heirship. His father,
on the other hand, wished to recognize such a contingency.
Boswell wrote to Johnson in 1776 for advice,
urging a series of objections, physiological and moral,
to the inheritance of a family estate by a woman;
though, as he magnanimously admits, “they should be
treated with great affection and tenderness, and always
participate of the prosperity of the family.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Johnson, for a wonder, took the other side, defended
female heirship, and finally summed up thus:
“It cannot but occur that women have natural and
equitable claims as well as men, and these claims are
not to be capriciously or lightly superseded or infringed.
When fiefs inspired military service, it is easily discerned
why females could not inherit them; but the
reason is at an end. <em>As manners make laws, so manners
likewise repeal them.</em>”</p>

<p class='c014'>This admirable statement should be carefully pondered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>by those who hold that suffrage should be only
co-extensive with military duty. The position that
woman cannot properly vote because she cannot fight
for her vote efficiently, is precisely like the position of
feudalism and of Boswell, that she could not properly
hold real estate because she could not fight for it.
Each position may have had some plausibility in its
day, but the same current of events has made each
obsolete. Those who in 1881 believe in giving woman
the ballot argue precisely as Dr. Johnson did in 1776.
Times have changed, manners have softened, education
has advanced, public opinion now acts more forcibly;
and the reference to physical force, though still implied,
is implied more and more remotely. The political event
of the age, the overthrow of American slavery, would
not have been accomplished without the “secular arm”
of Grant and Sherman, let us agree; but neither would
it have been accomplished without the moral power of
Garrison the non-resistant, and Harriet Beecher Stowe
the woman. When the work is done, it is unfair to disfranchise
any of the participants. Dr. Johnson was
right: “When fiefs [or votes] implied military service,
it is easily discerned why women should not inherit
[or possess] them; but the reason is at an end. As
manners make laws, so manners likewise repeal them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Under the feudal system it would have been absurd
that women should hold real estate, for the next armed
warrior could dispossess her. By Gail Hamilton’s
reasoning, it is equally absurd now: “One man is
stronger than one woman, and ten men are stronger
than ten women; and the nineteen millions of men in
this country will subdue, capture, and execute or expel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>the nineteen millions of women just as soon as they set
about it.” Very well: why, then, do not all the landless
men in a town unite, and take away the landed
property of all the women? Simply because we now
live in civilized society and under a reign of law; because
those men’s respect for law is greater than their
appetite for property; or, if you prefer, because even
those landless men know that their own interest lies,
in the long-run, on the side of law. It will be precisely
the same with voting. When any community is civilized
up to the point of enfranchising women, it will be
civilized up to the point of sustaining their vote, as it
now sustains their property-rights, by the whole material
force of the community. When the thing is once
established, it will no more occur to anybody that a
woman’s vote is powerless because she cannot fight,
than it now occurs to anybody that her title to real
estate is invalidated by the same circumstance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Woman is in the world; she cannot be got rid of:
she must be a serf or an equal; there is no middle
ground. We have outgrown the theory of serfdom in a
thousand ways, and may as well abandon the whole.
Women have now a place in society: their influence
will be exerted, at any rate, in war and in peace, legally
or illegally; and it had better be exerted in direct,
legitimate, and responsible methods, than in ways that
are dark, and by tricks that have not even the merit of
being plain.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XCVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>KILKENNY ARGUMENTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It always helps a good cause when its opponents are
in the position of the famous Kilkenny cats, and mutually
eat each other up. In the anti-slavery movement,
it was justly urged that the slaves might possibly be (as
slaveholders alleged) a race of petted children, whose
hearts could not possibly be alienated from their masters;
or they might be (as was also alleged by slaveholders)
a race of fiends, whom a whisper could madden:
but they could not well be both. Every claim
that the negro was happy was stultified by that other
claim, that the South was dwelling on a barrel of gunpowder,
and that the mildest anti-slavery tract meant
fire and explosion. The twin arguments saved abolitionists
a great deal of trouble. Either by itself would
have required an answer; but the two answered each
other,—devoured each other, in fact, like the Kilkenny
cats.</p>

<p class='c014'>So, whenever the advocates of woman suffrage are
assailed on the ground that women are too superstitious,
and will, if enfranchised, be governed by religion and
the Church alone, there is always sure to come in some
obliging advocate with his “Besides, the tendency of
the movement is to utter lawlessness, to the destruction
of religion, the marriage-vows, the home”—and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>the rest of it. The boy in the story is hardly more selfcontradictory,
when, in answer to his friend’s appeal for
his jack-knife, he replies, “I haven’t any. Besides, I
want to use it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here, for instance, is Mr. Nathan N. Withington of
Newbury, Mass., who in an address on woman suffrage,
while waiving many arguments against it, plants himself
strongly on the ground that it must be fatal to the
family. “No one whose opinion is worth reckoning,
with whom I have talked on the matter, ever denied entirely
that the logical result of the movement was what
is called free love.” My inference would be, in passing,
that my old neighbor Mr. Withington must confine
himself to a very narrow circle, in the way of conversation;
or, that he must find nobody’s opinion “worth
reckoning” if it differs from his own. Certainly I have
talked with hardly an advocate of woman suffrage in
New England who would not deny entirely—and
with a good deal of emphasis—any such assumptions
as he here makes. But let that go: the subject has
already been discussed far more than its intrinsic importance
required; and convention after convention has
taken unnecessary pains to refute a charge more baseless
than the slaveholders’ fears of insurrection. What
I wish to point out is, that such charges have, in one
way, great value: they precisely neutralize and utterly
annihilate the equally baseless terror of “Too superstitious.”</p>

<p class='c014'>If it is true, as is sometimes alleged, that women are
constitutionally under the dominion of religion and the
Church, then it is pretty sure, that, under these auspices,
the moral restraints of the community, as marriage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the home, will be maintained. If it is true on the other
hand, as Mr. Withington honestly thinks, that the tendency
of woman suffrage is to create a deluge that shall
sweep away the home, then it is certain that all vestiges
of churchly superstition will be swamped in the
process. The logical outcome of the movement may
be, if you please, to establish the Spanish Inquisition or
to bring back the horrors of the French Revolution, but
it seems clear that it cannot simultaneously bring both.
The advocates of both theories are equally sincere,
doubtless, in their predictions of alarm; but one set of
alarmists or the other set of alarmists must be wofully
disappointed when the time comes. And, if either, why
not both?</p>

<p class='c014'>The simple fact is, that whosoever draws upon his
imagination, for possible disasters from any particular
measure, has a great fund at his disposal, whether he
looks right or left. He has always this advantage over
the practical reformer, that whereas the claims of the
reformer are, or should be, definite, coherent, practical,
the opponent can, if he wishes, have the whole cloudy
domain of possibility to draw upon: he can marshal an
army in the atmosphere, while the practical reformer
must stay on earth. It is a comfort when two of these
nebulous armies of imaginary obstacles fight in the air,
as in the present case, like the shadowy hosts in Kaulbach’s
great cartoon; and so destroy one another,
bringing back clear sky.</p>

<p class='c014'>Woman needs the ballot for self-respect and self-protection,
and to do her share for the education and
moral safety of the children she bears. This is enough
to begin with. In seeking after this we have firm foothold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>The old Eastern fable describes a certain man
as finding a horse-shoe. His neighbor soon begins to
weep and wail, because, as he justly points out, the
man who has found a horse-shoe may some day find a
horse, and may shoe him; and the neighbor’s child may
some day go so near the horse’s heels as to be kicked,
and die; and then the two families may quarrel and
fight, and several valuable lives be lost through that
finding of a horse-shoe. The gradual advancement of
women must meet many fancies as far-fetched as this,
and must see them presented as arguments; and we
must be very grateful if they prove Kilkenny arguments,
and destroy one another.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>XCIX.<br /> <span class='large'>WOMEN AND PRIESTS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The chief reason given by the Italian radicals for
not supporting woman suffrage was the alleged readiness
of women to accept the control of the priests.
The same objection has, before now, been heard in
other countries,—in France, England, and America.
John Bright, especially, made it the ground of his opposition
to a movement in which several members of
his family have been much engaged. The same point
of view was presented, in this country, several years
ago, by Mr. Abbot of the Index. But to how much,
after all, does this objection amount?</p>

<p class='c014'>No one doubts that the religious sentiment seems
stronger in women than in men; but it must be remembered
that this sentiment has been laboriously encouraged
by men, while the field of action allowed to women
has been sedulously circumscribed, and her intellectual
education every way restricted. It is no wonder if,
under these circumstances, she has gone where she has
been welcomed, and not where she has been snubbed.
Priests were glad to hail her as a saint, while legislators
and professors joined in repelling her as a student or
a reformer. What wonder that she turned from the
study or the law-making of the world to its religion?
But in all this, whose was the fault,—hers, or those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>who took charge of her? If she did not trust the
clergy, who alone befriended her, whom should she
trust?</p>

<p class='c014'>But observe that the clergy of all ages, in concentrating
the strength of woman on her religious nature,
have summoned up a power that they could not control.
When they had once lost the confidence of those ruled
by this mighty religious sentiment, it was turned against
them. In the Greek and Roman worship, women were
the most faithful to the altars of the gods; yet, when
Christianity arose, the foremost martyrs were women.
In the Middle Ages women were the best Catholics, but
they were afterwards the best Huguenots. It was a
woman, not a man, who threw her stool at the offending
minister’s head in a Scotch kirk; it was a woman
who made the best Quaker martyr on Boston Common.
And, from vixenish Jenny Geddes to high-minded
Mary Dyer, the whole range of womanly temperament
responds as well to the appeal of religious freedom as
of religious slavery. It is religion that woman needs,
men say; but they omit to see that the strength of
her religious sentiment is seen when she resists her
clerical advisers as well as when she adores them or
pets them. Frances Wright and Lucretia Mott are
facts to be considered, quite as much as the matrons
and maids who work ecclesiastical slippers, and hold
fancy fairs to send their favorite clergymen to Europe.</p>

<p class='c014'>At any rate, if the clergy still retain too much of
their control, the evil is not to be corrected by leaving
the whole matter in their hands. The argument itself
must be turned the other way. Women need the
mental training of science to balance the over-sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>of religion; they need to participate in statesmanship
to develop the practical side of their lives. We
are outgrowing the sarcasm of the Frenchman who
said that in America there were but two amusements,—politics
for the men, and religion for the women. When
both women and men learn to mingle the two more
equally, both politics and religion will become something
more than an amusement.</p>

<p class='c031'>“Those who wish the Roman Catholic Church to subvert
our school system, control legislation, and become a mighty
political force, cannot do better than labor day and night for
woman suffrage. This, it is true, is opposed to every principle
and tradition of that great church, which nevertheless would
reap from it immense benefits. The priests have little influence
over a considerable part of their male flock; but their
power is great over the women, who would repair to the polls
at the word of command, with edifying docility and zeal.”—<span class='sc'>Francis
Parkman</span> <em>on “The Woman Question” in North
American Review</em>, September, 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am surprised that a man like Mr. Parkman, who
has done so much to vindicate the share of Roman
Catholic priests and laymen in the early settlement of
this continent, should have introduced this paragraph
into a serious discussion of what he himself recognizes
as an important question. Here is the case. One-half
the citizens of every State are unrepresented in the
government: the ordinary means of republican influence
are withheld from them, as they are from idiots
and criminals. It is the rights and claims of these
women, as women, that statesmanship has to consider.
Whether their enfranchisement will help the nation or
the race, as a whole, is legitimate matter for argument.
Whether their votes will temporarily tell for this or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>that party or sect, is a wholly subordinate matter, that
ought not to be obtruded into a serious debate. If
republican government is not strong enough to stand
on its own principles, if its fundamental theory must
be interpreted and modified so that it shall work for or
against a particular church or class of citizens, then it
is a worse failure than even Mr. Parkman represents
it. The “woman question,” whenever it is settled,
must be settled on its own merits, with no more reference
to Roman Catholics, as such, than to Mormons or
Chinese. Having said this before, when advocates of
woman suffrage were presenting the movement as an
anti-Catholic movement, I can consistently repeat it
now, when the movement is charged with being unconsciously
pro-Catholic in its tendencies. It is not its
business to be for or against any religion: its business
is with principles.</p>

<p class='c014'>The paragraph throws needless odium on a large and
an inseparable portion of the community,—the Roman
Catholics. “Aliens to our blood and race!” cried
indignantly the orator Shiel, in the House of Commons,
when some one had thus characterized the Irish.
“Heavens! have I not, upon the battle-field, seen
those aliens do their duty to England?” It is too
soon after the great civil war to stigmatize, even by
implication, a class on whom we were then glad to call.
Whole regiments of Roman Catholics were then called
into the service; Roman Catholic chaplains were commissioned,
than whom none did their duty better, or in
a less sectarian spirit. In case of another war, all
these would be summoned to duty again. We have no
right, in reasoning on American institutions, to treat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>this religious element as something by itself, an alien
member, not to be assimilated, virtually antagonistic to
republican government. It has never proved to be so
in Switzerland, where about half the cantons are overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic, and yet the federal union
is preserved, and the republican feeling is as strong in
these cantons as in any other.</p>

<p class='c014'>No doubt there would be great objections to the
domination of any single religious body, and the more
thorough its organization the worse; but this is an
event in the last degree improbable in any State of the
Union. It is doubtful if even the Roman Catholic
Church will ever again be relatively so powerful as in
the early years of our government, when it probably
had a majority of the population in three States,—Maryland,
Louisiana, and Kentucky,—whereas now it
has lost it in all. It may be many years before we again
see, as we saw for a quarter of a century, a Roman
Catholic chief justice of the United States (Taney).
If we ever see this church come into greater power, it
will be because it shows, as in England, such tact and
discretion and moderation as to disarm opposition, and
earn the right to influence. The common feeling and
prejudice of American people is, and is likely to remain,
overwhelmingly against it; and none know this better
than the Roman Catholic priests themselves. They
know very well that nothing would more exasperate
this feeling than to marshal women to the polls like
sheep; and this alone would prevent their doing it,
were there no other obstacle.</p>

<p class='c014'>The abolitionists used to say that the instinct of any
class of oppressors was infallible, and that if the slaveholders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>for instance, dreaded a certain policy, that
policy was the wise one for the slaves. If the priests
are such oppressors as Mr. Parkman thinks, they must
have the instinct of that class; and their present unanimous
opposition to woman suffrage is sufficient proof
that it promises no good to them. How easy it is to
misinterpret their policy, has been shown in the school
suffrage matter. It was confidently stated that a certain
priest in the city where I live, had demanded from
the pulpit a certain sum—two thousand dollars—to
pay the poll-taxes for women voters. Most people
believed it; yet, when it came to the point, not a
Roman Catholic woman applied for assessment. It
will be thus with Mr. Parkman’s fears. Women will
ultimately vote,—as indeed, he seems rather to expect;
and the effect will be to make them more intelligent,
and therefore less likely to obey the will of any man.
Roman Catholic men are learning to think for themselves;
and the best way to make women do so is to
treat them as intelligent and responsible beings.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CI.<br /> <span class='large'>DANGEROUS VOTERS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One of the few plausible objections brought against
women’s voting is this: that it would demoralize the
suffrage by letting in very dangerous voters; that virtuous
women would not vote, and vicious women would.
It is a very unfounded alarm.</p>

<p class='c014'>For, in the first place, our institutions rest—if they
have any basis at all—on this principle, that good is
stronger than evil, that the majority of men really wish
to vote rightly, and that only time and patience are
needed to get the worst abuses righted. How any one
can doubt this, who watches the course of our politics,
I do not see. In spite of the great disadvantage of
having masses of ignorant foreign voters to deal with,—and
of native black voters, who have been purposely
kept in ignorance,—we certainly see wrongs gradually
righted, and the truth by degrees prevail. Even the
one great, exceptional case of New York City has been
reached at last; and the very extent of the evil has
brought its own cure. Now, why should this triumph
of good over evil be practicable among men, and not
apply to women also?</p>

<p class='c014'>It must be either because women, as a class, are
worse than men,—which will hardly be asserted,—or
because, for some special reason, bad women have an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>advantage over good women such as has no parallel in
the other sex. But I do not see how this can be. Let
us consider.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is certain that good women are not less faithful
and conscientious than good men. It is generally admitted
that those most opposed to suffrage will very
soon, on being fully enfranchised, feel it their duty to
vote. They may at first misuse the right through ignorance,
but they certainly will not shirk it. It is this
conscientious habit on which I rely without fear. Never
yet, when public duty required, have American women
failed to meet the emergency; and I am not afraid of
it now. Moreover, when they are once enfranchised
and their votes are needed, all the men who now oppose
or ridicule the demand for suffrage will begin to help
them to exercise it. When the wives are once enfranchised,
you may be sure that the husbands will not
neglect those of their own household: they will provide
them with ballots, vehicles, and policemen, and will contrive
to make the voting-places pleasanter than many
parlors, and quieter than some churches.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the other hand, it seems altogether probable that
the very worst women, so far from being ostentatious
in their wickedness upon election-day, will, on the contrary,
so disguise and conceal themselves as to deceive
the very elect, and, if it were possible, the very policemen.
For whatever party they may vote, they will
contribute to make the voting-places as orderly as
railway-stations. These covert ways are the very habit
of their lives, at least by daylight; and the women who
have of late done the most conspicuous and open mischief
in our community have done it, not in their true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>character as evil, but, on the contrary, under a mask
of elevated purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>That women, when they vote, will commit their full
share of errors, I have always maintained. But that
they will collectively misuse their power, seems to me
out of the question; and that the good women are going
to stay at home, and let bad women do the voting, appears
quite as incredible. In fact, if they do thus, it
is a fair question whether the epithets “good” and
“bad” ought not, politically speaking, to change
places. For it naturally occurs to every one, on election-day,
that the man who votes, even if he votes
wrong, is really a better man, so far as political duties
go, than the very loftiest saint who stays at home and
prays that other people may vote right. And it is hard
to see why it should be otherwise with women.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>
  <h3 class='c004'>CII.<br /> <span class='large'>HOW WOMEN WILL LEGISLATE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is often said, that, when women vote, their votes
will make no difference in the count, because they will
merely duplicate the votes of their husbands and brothers.
Then these same objectors go on and predict all
sorts of evil things, for which women will vote, quite
apart from their husbands and brothers. Moreover,
the evils thus predicted are apt to be diametrically
opposite. Thus Goldwin Smith predicts that women
will be governed by priests, and then goes on to predict
that women will vote to abolish marriage; not
seeing, that, as Professor Cairnes has pointed out,
these two predictions destroy each other.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the other hand, I think that the advocates of
woman suffrage often err by claiming too much,—as
that all women will vote for peace, for total abstinence,
against slavery, and the rest. It seems better to rest
the argument on general principles, and not to seek to
prophesy too closely. The only thing which I feel
safe in predicting is, that woman suffrage will be used,
as it should be, for the protection of woman. Self-respect
and self-protection,—these are, as has been already
said, the two great things for which woman needs
the ballot.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not the nature of things, I take it, that a class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>politically subject can obtain justice from the governing
class. Not the least of the benefits gained by
political equality for the colored people of the South is,
that the laws now generally make no difference of
color in penalties for crime. In slavery times, there
were dozens of crimes which were punished more
severely by the statute if committed by a slave or a
free negro, than if done by a white. I feel very sure
that under the reign of impartial suffrage we should
see fewer such announcements as this, which I cut
from a late New York “Evening Express:”—</p>

<p class='c021'>“Last night Capt. Lowery, of the Twenty-seventh Precinct,
made a descent upon the dance-house in the basement of 96
Greenwich Street, and arrested fifty-two men and eight women.
The entire batch was brought before Justice Flammer, at the
Tombs Police Court, this morning. Louise Maud, the proprietress,
was held in five hundred dollars bail to answer at
the Court of General Sessions. <em>The fifty-two men were fined
three dollars each, all but twelve paying at once; and the eight
women were fined ten dollars each, and sent to the Island for
one month.</em>”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Italics are my own. When we reflect that this
dance-house, whatever it was, was unquestionably sustained
for the gratification of men, rather than of
women; when we consider that every one of these fifty-two
men came there, in all probability, by his own free
will, and to spend money, not to earn it; and that the
undoubted majority of the women were driven there by
necessity or betrayal, or force or despair,—it would
seem that even an equal punishment would have been
cruel injustice to the women. But when we observe
how trifling a penalty was three dollars each to these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>men, whose money was sure to go for riotous living in
some form, and forty of whom had the amount of the
fine in their pockets; and how hopelessly large an
amount was ten dollars each to women who did not,
probably, own even the clothes they wore, and who
were to be sent to prison for a month in addition,—we
see a kind of injustice which would stand a fair chance
of being righted, I suspect, if women came into power.
Not that they would punish their own sex less severely;
probably they would not: but they would put men more
on a level as to the penalty.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may be said that no such justice is to be expected
from women; because women in what is called “society”
condemn women for mere imprudence, and excuse
men for guilt. But it must be remembered, that in
“society” guilt is rarely a matter of open proof and
conviction, in case of men: it is usually a matter of
surmise; and it is easy for either love or ambition to
set the surmise aside, and to assume that the worst
reprobate is “only a little wild.” In fact, as Margaret
Fuller pointed out years ago, how little conception has
a virtuous woman as to what a dissipated young man
really is! But let that same woman be a Portia, in the
judgment-seat, or even a legislator or a voter, and let
her have the unmistakable and actual offender before
her, and I do not believe that she will excuse him for
a paltry fine, and give the less guilty woman a penalty
more than quadruple.</p>

<p class='c014'>Women will also be sure to bring special sympathy
and intelligent attention to the wrongs of children.

  <h4 class='c019'>THE CHILD-SELLING CASE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Peter Hallock, committed on a charge of abducting Lena
Dinser, a young girl thirteen years old, whom, it was alleged,
her father, George Dinser, had sold to Hallock for purposes
of prostitution, was again brought yesterday before Judge
Westbrook in the Supreme Court Chambers, on the writ of
habeas-corpus previously obtained by Mr. William F. Howe,
the prisoner’s counsel. Mr. Howe claimed that Hallock could
not be held on either section of the statute for abduction.
Under the first section the complaint, he insisted, should set
forth that the child was taken contrary to the wish and against
the consent of her parents. On the contrary, the evidence, he
urged, showed that the father was a willing party. Under the
second section, it was contended that the prisoner could not be
held, as there was no averment that the girl was of previous
chaste character. Judge Westbrook, a brief counter argument
having been made by Mr. Dana, held that the points of Mr.
Howe were well taken, and ordered the prisoner’s discharge.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here was a father, who, as the newspapers allege,
had previously sold two other daughters, body and
soul, and against whom the evidence seemed to be in
this case clear. Yet through the defectiveness of the
statute, or the remissness of the prosecuting attorney,
he goes free, without even a trial, to carry on his infamous
traffic for other children. Grant that the points
were technically well taken and irresistible,—though
this is by no means certain,—it is very sure that there
should be laws that should reach such atrocities with
punishment, whether the father does or does not consent
to his child’s ruin; and that public sentiment
should compel prosecuting officers to be as careful in
framing their indictments where human souls are at
stake as where the question is of dollars only. It is
upon such matters that the influence of women will
make itself felt in legislation.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CIII.<br /> <span class='large'>WARNED IN TIME.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As a reform advances, it draws in more and more
people who are not immaculate. Such people are often
found, indeed, among the very pioneers of reform; and
their number naturally increases as the reform grows
popular. The larger a coral island grows, the more
driftwood attaches itself; and the coral insects might
as well stipulate that every floating log should be sound
and stanch, as a reform that all its converts should be
in the highest degree reputable. We expect, sooner or
later, to be in the majority. But we certainly do not
expect to find all that majority saints.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet many good people are constantly distressing
themselves, and writing letters of remonstrance, public
or private, to editors, because this or that unscrupulous
person chooses to join our army. If we select that
person for a general, we are doubtless to be held responsible;
but for nothing else. People may indeed
say—and justly—that every such ally brings suspicion
upon us. Very likely; then we must work harder
to avert suspicion. People may urge that no reform
was ever watched so anxiously as this, for its effect on
female character especially, and that a single discreditable
instance may do incalculable harm. No doubt.
And yet, after all, we are to work with human means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and under human limitations; and God accomplishes
much good in this world through rather poor instruments—such
as you and me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have no manner of doubt that the great majority
of those who take up this movement will do it from
tolerably pure motives, and will, on the whole, do credit
to it by their personal demeanor. But of course there
will be exceptions,—hypocrites, self-seekers, and black
sheep generally. Horace Mann used to say that the
clergy were, on the whole, pure men; but that some
of the worst men in every age and place were always
found among the clergy also,—taking that disguise as
a cloak for wickedness. For “clergy” in this case
read “reformers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And there is this special good done, in a reform, by
the sinners who take hold of it, that they warn us in
time that all reform is limited by the imperfections of
average humanity. The theory of the Roman Catholic
Church is a sublime one,—that every pope should be
a saint; but it is limited by the practical difficulty of
securing a sufficient supply of the article. So it is
with the woman suffrage movement. “Would it not
be desirable,” write enthusiastic correspondents, “that
every woman in this sacred enterprise should have a
heart free from guile?” Perhaps not. The plan looks
attractive certainly; but would there not be this objection,
that, could you enlist this regiment of perfect
beings, they would give a very false impression of the
sex for which they stand? If women are not all saints,—if
they are capable, like men, of selfishness and
ambition, malice and falsehood,—it is of great importance
that we should be warned in time. Better see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>their faults now, and enfranchise them with our eyes
open, than enfranchise them as angels, and then be
dismayed when they turn out to be human beings.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no use in carrying this reform, or any
other, on mistaken expectations. Multitudes of persons
are looking to woman suffrage, mainly as a means
of elevating politics. Every woman who awakens distrust
or contempt damps the ardor of these persons.
It is a misfortune that they should be discouraged;
but, if they have idealized woman too much, they may
as well be disenchanted first as last. Woman does not
need the ballot chiefly that she may take it in her
hands, and elevate man; but she needs it primarily for
her own defence, just as men need it. Which will use
it best, who can say? Women are doubtless less sensual
than men; but the sensual vices are the very least
of the vices that corrupt our politics. Selfishness, envy,
jealousy, vanity, cowardice, bigotry, caste-prejudice,
recklessness of assertion,—these are the traits that
demoralize our public men. Is there any reason to believe
that women are, on the whole, more free from
these? If not, we may as well know it by visible,
though painful, examples. Knowing it, we may take
a reasonable view of woman, and legislate for her as
she is. I do not believe with Mrs. Croly, that “women
are nearly all treacherous and cruel to each other;”
but I believe that they are, as Gen. Saxton described
the negroes, “intensely human,” and that we may as
well be warned of this in time.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CIV.<br /> <span class='large'>INDIVIDUALS <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vs.</span></i> CLASSES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As the older arguments against woman suffrage are
abandoned, we hear more and more of the final objection,
that the majority of women have not yet expressed
themselves on the subject. It is common for such reasoners
to make the remark, that if they knew a given
number of women—say fifty, or a hundred, or five
hundred—who honestly wished to vote, they would
favor it. Produce that number of unimpeachable
names, and they say that they have reconsidered the
matter, and must demand more,—perhaps ten thousand.
Bring ten thousand, and the demand again
rises. “Prove that the majority of women wish to
vote, and they shall vote.”—“Precisely,” we say:
“give us a chance to prove it by taking a vote;” and
they answer, “By no means.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And, in a certain sense, they are right. It ought not
to be settled that way,—by dealing with woman as a
class, and taking the vote. The agitators do not merely
claim the right of suffrage for her as a class: they claim
it for each individual woman, without reference to any
other. Class legislation—as Mary Ann in Bret Harte’s
“Lothaw” says of Brook Farm—“is a thing of the
past.” If there is only one woman in the nation who
claims the right to vote, she ought to have it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>In Oriental countries all legislation is for classes,
and in England it is still mainly so. A man is expected
to remain in the station in which he is born; or, if he
leaves it, it is by a distinct process, and he comes under
the influence, in various ways, of different laws. If
the iniquities of the “Contagious Diseases” act in
England, for instance, had not been confined in their
legal application to the lower social grades, the act
would never have passed. It was easy for men of the
higher classes to legislate away the modesty of women
of the lower classes; but if the daughter of an earl
could have been arrested, and submitted to a surgical
examination at the will of any policeman, as the daughter
of a mechanic now can, the law would not have
stood a day. So, through all our slave States, there
was class legislation for every person of negro blood:
the laws of crime, of punishment, of testimony, were all
adapted to classes, not individuals. Emancipation
swept this all away, in most cases: classes ceased to
exist before the law, so far as men at least were concerned;
there were only individuals. The more progress,
the less class in legislation. We claim the application
of this principle as rapidly as possible to women.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our community does not refuse permission for
women to go unveiled till it is proved that the majority
of women desire it; it does not even ask that question:
if one woman wishes to show her face, it is allowed. If
a woman wishes to travel alone, to walk the streets
alone, the police protects her in that liberty. She is
not thrust back into her house with the reproof, “My
dear madam, at this particular moment the overwhelming
majority of women are indoors: prove that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>all wish to come out, and you shall come.” On the
contrary, she comes forth at her own sweet will: the
policeman helps her tenderly across the street, and
waves back with imperial gesture the obtrusive coal-cart.
Some of us claim for each individual woman, in
the same way, not merely the right to go shopping, but
to go voting; not merely to show her face, but to show
her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>There will always be many women, as there are many
men, who are indifferent to voting. For a time,
perhaps always, there will be a larger percentage
of this indifference among women. But the natural
right to a share in the government under which one
lives, and to a voice in making the laws under which
one may be hanged,—this belongs to each woman as
an individual; and she is quite right to claim it as she
needs it, even though the majority of her sex still prefer
to take their chance of the penalty, without perplexing
themselves about the law. The demand of
every enlightened woman who asks for the ballot—like
the demand of every enlightened slave for freedom—is
an individual demand; and the question
whether they represent the majority of their class has
nothing to do with it. For a republic like ours does
not profess to deal with classes, but with individuals;
since “the whole people covenants with each citizen, and
each citizen with the whole people, for the common
good,” as the constitution of Massachusetts says.</p>

<p class='c014'>And, fortunately, there is such power in an individual
demand that it appeals to thousands whom no
abstract right touches. Five minutes with Frederick
Douglass settled the question, for any thoughtful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>person, of that man’s right to freedom. Let any
woman of position desire to enter what is called “the
lecture-field,” to support herself and her children, and
at once all abstract objections to women’s speaking in
public disappear: her friends may be never so hostile
to “the cause,” but they espouse her individual cause;
the most conservative clergyman subscribes for tickets,
but begs that his name may not be mentioned. They
do not admit that women, as a class, should speak,—not
they; but for this individual woman they throng
the hall. Mrs. Dahlgren abhors politics: a woman in
Congress, a woman in the committee-room,—what can
be more objectionable? But I observe, that, when
Mrs. Dahlgren wishes to obtain more profit by her
husband’s inventions, all objections vanish: she can
appeal to Congressmen, she can address committees,
she can, I hope, prevail. The individual ranks first in
our sympathy: we do not wait to take the census of
the “class.” Make way for the individual, whether it
be Mrs. Dahlgren pleading for the rights of property,
or Lucy Stone pleading for the rights of the mother
to her child.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>After one of the early defeats in the War of the
Rebellion, the commander of a Massachusetts regiment
wrote home to his father: “I wish people would not
write us so many letters of condolence. Our defeat
seemed to trouble them much more than it troubles us.
Did people suppose there were to be no ups and downs?
We expect to lose plenty of battles, but we have enlisted
for the war.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It is just so with every successful reform. While
enemies and half-friends are proclaiming its defeats,
those who advocate it are rejoicing that they have at
last got an army into the field to be defeated. Unless
this war is to be an exception to all others, even the
fact of having joined battle is a great deal. It is the
first step. Defeat first; a good many defeats, if you
please: victory by and by.</p>

<p class='c014'>William Wilberforce, writing to a friend in the year
1817, said, “I continue faithful to the measure of Parliamentary
reform brought forward by Mr. Pitt. I am
firmly persuaded that at present a prodigious majority
of the people of this country are adverse to the measure.
In my view, so far from being an objection to
the discussion, this is rather a recommendation.” In
1832 the reform-bill was passed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>In the first Parliamentary debate on the slave-trade,
Col. Tarleton, who boasted to have killed more men
than any one in England, pointing to Wilberforce and
others, said, “The inspiration began on that side of
the house;” then turning round, “The revolution has
reached to this also, and reached to the height of fanaticism
and frenzy.” The first vote in the House of
Commons, in 1790, after arguments in the affirmative
by Wilberforce, Pitt, Fox, and Burke, stood, ayes, 88;
noes, 163: majority against the measure, 75. In 1807
the slave-trade was abolished, and in 1834 slavery in
the British colonies followed; and even on the very
night when the latter bill passed, the abolitionists were
taunted by Gladstone, the great Demerara slaveholder,
with having toiled for forty years and done
nothing. The Roman Catholic relief-bill, establishing
freedom of thought in England, had the same experience.
It passed in 1829 by a majority of a hundred
and three in the House of Lords, which had nine
months before refused by a majority of forty-five to
take up the question at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>The English corn-laws went down a quarter of a
century ago, after a similar career of failures. In
1840, there were hundreds of thousands in England
who thought that to attack the corn-laws was to attack
the very foundations of society. Lord Melbourne, the
prime minister, said in Parliament, that “he had heard
of many mad things in his life, but, before God, the
idea of repealing the corn-laws was the very maddest
thing of which he had ever heard.” Lord John Russell
counselled the House to refuse to hear evidence on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>operation of the corn-laws. Six years after, in 1846,
they were abolished forever.</p>

<p class='c014'>How Wendell Phillips, in the anti-slavery meetings,
used to lash pro-slavery men with such formidable facts
as these,—and to quote how Clay and Calhoun and
Webster and Everett had pledged themselves that
slavery should never be discussed, or had proposed
that those who discussed it should be imprisoned,—while,
in spite of them all, the great reform was moving
on, and the abolitionists were forcing politicians
and people to talk, like Sterne’s starling, nothing but
slavery!</p>

<p class='c014'>We who were trained in the light of these great agitations
have learned their lesson. We expect to march
through a series of defeats to victory. The first thing
is, as in the anti-slavery movement, so to arouse the
public mind as to make this the central question. Given
this prominence, and it is enough for this year or for
many years to come. Wellington said that there was
no such tragedy as a victory, except a defeat. On the
other hand, the next best thing to a victory is a defeat,
for it shows that the armies are in the field. Without
the unsuccessful attempt of to-day, no success to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Mrs. Frances Anne Kemble came to this country,
she was amazed to find Americans celebrating the
battle of Bunker Hill, which she had always heard
claimed as a victory for King George. Such it was
doubtless called; but what we celebrated was the fact
that the Americans there threw up breastworks, stood
their ground, fired away their ammunition,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>were defeated. And thus the reformer, looking at
his failures, often sees in them such a step forward,
that they are the Bunker Hill of a new revolution.
Give us plenty of such defeats, and we can afford to
wait a score of years for the victories. They will
come.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
